it O

First B-MISC

as O

preparing O

the O
Nicaraguan B-MISC
foreign O

publicly O
called O
upon O

make O
good O
on O
the O
previous O

promise O
of O
US$ B-MISC
100 I-MISC

This O
remark O
sparked O
controversy O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC

where O
some O
accused O
the O
new O
government O
of O
pursuing O
the O
same O
" O
checkbook O
diplomacy O
" O
practiced O
by O
its O
predecessor O
. O

Chen B-PER

bian I-PER
responded O
that O
while O
the O
new O
administration O
has O
not O
made O
plans O
for O
any O
new O
promises O
of O
foreign O
aid O
, O
neither O
will O
it O
fail O
to O
honor O
the O
promises O
made O
by O
its O
predecessor O
. O

Foreign O
Minister O
Tien B-PER
Hung I-PER
- I-PER
mao I-PER
stated O
that O
the O
purpose O
of O
Chen B-PER
's O
trip O
was O
to O
consolidate O
Taiwan B-LOC
's O
diplomatic O
ties O
, O
and O
to O
strengthen O
friendships O
by O
building O
upon O
the O
existing O
foundation O
. O

Tien B-PER
stressed O
that O
the O
president O
would O
not O
sign O
any O
new O
foreign O
aid O
agreements O
. O

President O
Chen B-PER
received O
a O
very O
warm O
welcome O
in O
Nicaragua B-LOC
, O
but O
the O
local O
press O
still O
mentioned O
" O
checkbook O
diplomacy O
" O
in O
reporting O
on O
the O
visit O
. O

The O
ROC B-LOC
's O
ambassador O
to O
Nicaragua B-LOC
, O
Antonio B-PER
Tsai I-PER
, O
bluntly O
argued O
in O
a O
briefing O
with O
Chen B-PER
that O
Taiwan B-LOC
's O
foreign O
assistance O
to O
Nicaragua B-LOC
was O
being O
misused O
. O

According O
to O
Tsai B-PER
, O
the O
assistance O
has O
been O
used O
to O
build O
a O
presidential O
palace O
and O
a O
new O
headquarters O
for O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
. O

Opposition O
politicians O
charge O
that O
the O
aid O
has O
done O
nothing O
for O
everyday O
people O
, O
and O
Western B-MISC
nations O
have O
also O
been O
critical O
. O

A O
second B-MISC
problem O
connected O
with O
the O
trip O
was O
the O
question O
of O
who O
would O
act O
in O
the O
president O
's O
stead O
while O
he O
was O
out O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Concern O
over O
this O
issue O
prompted O
President O
Chen B-PER
to O
state O
before O
his O
departure O
that O
he O
would O
remain O
commander O
- O
in O
- O
chief O
of O
the O
military O
forces O
, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
maintain O
hot O
lines O
to O
every O
cabinet O
- O
level O
agency O
. O

The O
president O
said O
that O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
an O
acting O
president O
because O
he O
had O
taken O
painstaking O
precautions O
to O
ensure O
domestic O
political O
stability O
during O

So O
is O
Taiwan B-LOC
's O
diplomacy O
a O
way O
of O
giving O
back O
to O
the O
international O
community O
? O

Or O
is O
it O
checkbook O
diplomacy O
? O

Ambassador O
- O
without O
- O
portfolio O
Lu B-PER
Yi I-PER
- I-PER
cheng I-PER
wrote O
an O
article O
in O
which O
he O
argued O
that O
foreign O
aid O
has O
always O
been O
universally O
recognized O
as O
a O
regular O
tool O
of O
diplomacy O
as O
well O
as O
a O
humanitarian O
necessity O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
why O
Taiwan B-LOC
should O
have O
to O
steer O
clear O
of O
it O
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
world O
's O
developed O
nations O
spend O
an O
average O
of O
0.24 B-MISC
% I-MISC
of O
GNP O
on O
foreign O
aid O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
0.17 B-MISC
% I-MISC
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
's O
case O
. O

In O
view O
of O
Taiwan B-LOC
's O
economic O
strength O
, O
argued O
Lu B-PER
, O
our O
foreign O
aid O
expenditures O
need O
not O
be O
reduced O
; O
in O
fact O
, O
they O
should O
even O
be O
raised O
somewhat O
. O

The O
ROC B-LOC
has O
been O
criticized O
a O
lot O
in O
recent O
years O
for O
pursuing O
checkbook O
diplomacy O
, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
surprise O
when O
this O
issue O
cropped O
up O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
president O
's O
trip O
. O

The O
question O
of O
an O
acting O
president O
, O
however O
, O
has O
never O
before O
been O
a O
matter O
of O
concern O
. O

This O
situation O
is O
to O
some O
degree O
a O
reflection O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
public O
still O
has O
doubts O
about O
the O
new O
administration O
's O
ability O
to O
govern O
. O

This O
is O
an O
important O
point O
that O
is O
worth O
keeping O
in O
mind O

The B-MISC
year I-MISC
2001 I-MISC
has O
started O
with O
a O
series O
of O
saddening O

in O
the O

On O
the B-MISC
first I-MISC

the I-MISC

, O
Hsu B-PER
Tsang-houei I-PER

the O

passed O

after O

Then O
came O
the O
news O
that O

the O

the O

These O
three B-MISC

all O
in O
their O
early B-MISC

Since O

a O
time O

they O

one O

Each O

these O

at O

Where O

go O
? O

Hsu B-PER
Tsang-houei I-PER
had O
a O
huge O
impact O
on O
Taiwanese B-MISC

over O
the B-MISC
last I-MISC
half I-MISC
century I-MISC
. O

Born O
in O
Homei B-LOC

Changhua I-LOC
in O
1928 B-MISC
, O
Hsu B-PER
studied O
the O

in O
Japan B-LOC
as O
a O
youth O
. O

Later O
, O
he O
studied O
in O
France B-LOC
for O
five B-MISC

, O
where O
he O
became O
well O

in O
the O
various O

of O
modern O
Western B-MISC

In O
1959 B-MISC
he O
returned O
to O

modern O

He O
also O
published O
a O

, O
" B-MISC
Where I-MISC

" I-MISC
in O
which O
he O
passionately O
urged O
his O
fellow O
musicians O
to O
create O
contemporary O
Chinese B-MISC

. O

Many O
young O
composers O
took O
up O
his O

wrote O
difficult O

dissonant O
twelve B-MISC

that O
would O
become O
the O
creative O

in O

Unfortunately O
, O
schools O
of O
modern O
classical O
music O
struggled O
to O
hold O
their O
audiences O
even O
in O
the O
West B-MISC
, O
and O
audiences O
found O
it O
harder O
and O
harder O
to O
connect O
with O
the O
Taiwanese B-MISC
modern O
music O
of O
which O
Hsu B-PER
was O
the O
leading O
figure O
. O

Opinion O
has O
remained O

about O
the O

this O

Hsu B-PER
was O
also O
at O
the O
forefront O
of O
efforts O
to O

In O
the B-MISC

, O
Hsu B-PER
, O
Shih B-PER
Wei-liang I-PER

Fighting O
the O

Hsu B-PER
led O

In O

with O

Just O
as O
Hsu B-PER

work O
spanned O
from O
the O
classical O
to O
the O
contemporary O
, O
from O
the O
West B-MISC
to O
his O
native O
soil O
, O
the O
archaeologist O
Chang B-PER
Kwang-chih I-PER
's O
broad O
vision O
allowed O
him O
to O
build O
the O
foundations O
for O
the O
field O
of O
archeology O
both O
for O
Taiwan B-LOC
and O
China B-LOC
as O
a O
whole O
. O

In O
his O
autobiography O
, O
Chang B-PER
describes O
himself O
as O
a O
" O
Yam O
Man O
, O
" O
which O
is O
an O
allusion O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
being O
shaped O
like O
a O
yam O
. O

Chang B-PER
explains O
that O
he O
was O
actually O
born O
in O
Beijing B-LOC
, O
though O
his O
father O
's O
family O
was O
indeed O
from O
Taiwan B-LOC
. O

After O
Taiwan B-LOC
was O
returned O
to O
Chinese B-MISC
rule O
, O
Chang B-PER
returned O
to O
the O
land O
of O
his O
roots O
. O

Studying O
at O
Chienkuo B-ORG
High I-ORG
in O
1949 B-MISC
, O
he O
was O
arrested O
on O
false O
charges O
of O
having O
participated O
in O
the B-MISC
April I-MISC
6 I-MISC
Incident I-MISC
. O

He O
spent O
nearly O
a O
year B-MISC
in O
jail O
before O
taking O
the O
high O
school O
equivalency O
exam O
and O
going O
on O
to O
study O
archeology O
at O
NTU B-ORG

After O
earning O
his O
doctorate O
at O
Harvard B-ORG
, O
he O
took O
an O
academic O
post O
in O
America B-LOC
but O
always O
maintained O
his O
focus O
on O
Chinese B-MISC
archeology O
. O

Largely O
due O
to O
his O
unflagging O
efforts O
, O
Chinese B-MISC
archeology O
attained O
a O
sturdy O
theoretical O
and O
practical O
foundation O
that O
enabled O
it O
to O
emerge O
as O
a O
world-class O
discipline O
. O

His O
research O
showed O
that O
the O
rise O
of O
Chinese B-MISC
civilization O
did O
not O
occur O
exclusively O
in O
the O
area O
around O
the B-MISC
Yellow I-MISC
River I-MISC
Valley I-MISC
. O

Rather O
it O
emerged O
from O
several O
languages O
, O
ethnic O
groups O
and O
cultures O
spread O
over O
a O
vast O
landscape O
. O

This O
overturned O
the O
" O
single O
origin O
theory O
" O
and O
debunked O
Western B-MISC
assumptions O
about O
" O
oriental O
despotism O
. O
" O

Though O
a O
world-class O
scholar O
, O
Chang B-PER
never O
forgot O
the O
land O
of O
his O
origins O
. O

In O
the B-MISC
1960s I-MISC
, O
he O
returned O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
and O
embarked O
on O
research O
at O
the O
Fengpitou B-MISC
site O
in O
Kaohsiung B-LOC
, O
completing O
the O
most O
extensive O
archeological O
study O
made O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
in O
over O
a O
century B-MISC
. O

Then O
he O
went O
on O
to O
perform O
research O
in O
an O
area O
that O
spanned O
the O
Choshui B-MISC
and O
Tatu B-MISC
river O
valleys O
. O

It O
was O
a O
huge O
undertaking O
that O
involved O
both O
archeology O
and O
geology O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
leading O
lights O
among O
the O
younger O
generation O
of O
Taiwan B-LOC
anthropologists O
cut O
their O
research O
teeth O
on O
this O
project O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
Chang B-PER
Kwang-chih I-PER
became O
afflicted O
with O
Parkinson B-PER

disease O
more B-MISC
than I-MISC
a I-MISC
decade I-MISC
ago I-MISC
. O

His O
limbs O
started O
to O
shake O
, O
and O
it O
became O
impossible O
for O
him O
to O
perform O
fieldwork O
. O

Chang B-PER
deeply O
regretted O
that O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
examine O
the O
Shangqiu B-MISC

in O
eastern O
Henan B-LOC

Though O
sick O

Chang B-PER
returned O

Finally O
there O
was O
the O
death O
of O
the O
historian O
Tai B-PER
Kuo-hui I-PER

who O
served O
on O

was O
admired O
as O
much O
for O

in O
Taiwanese B-MISC
history O

His O
differences O

with O
Lee B-PER
Teng-hui I-PER
had O
thrust O
him O
into O
the O
spotlight O
in O
recent B-MISC
years I-MISC

Born O
in O
1931 B-MISC
in O
Taoyuan B-LOC

Tai B-PER
was O
educated O
under O
Japanese B-MISC
colonial O
rule O
, O
and O
he O
earned O
a O
doctorate O
in O
agriculture O
at O
Tokyo B-LOC

Back O
in O
the B-MISC
1960s I-MISC
, O
when O
Taiwanese B-MISC
history O
was O
still O
a O
taboo O
subject O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
Tai B-PER
organized O
a O
research O
society O
in O
Japan B-LOC
devoted O
to O
the O
study O
of O
Taiwanese B-MISC
history O
and O
other O
related O
Asian B-MISC
topics O
. O

For O
this O
work O
, O
he O
was O
blacklisted O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
. O

Later O
, O
Tai B-PER
repeatedly O
declined O
invitations O
from O
Chiang B-PER
Ching-kuo I-PER
to O
return O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
until O
Lee B-PER
Teng-hui I-PER
was O
president O
that O
he O
finally O
came O
home O
. O

But O
when O
he O
did O
, O
his O
different O
perspective O
about O
Taiwan B-LOC
history O
brought O
Tai B-PER
Kuo-hui I-PER
farther O
and O
farther O
from O
the O
mainstream O
of O
the O
ruling O
party O
. O

Although O
Tai B-PER
did O
n't O
flinch O
from O
condemning O
the O
authoritarianism O
of O
Chiang B-PER
Kai-shek I-PER
and O
his O
son O
Chiang B-PER
Ching-kuo I-PER
, O
he O
also O
had O
harsh O
things O
to O
say O
about O
Japanese B-MISC
colonial O
rule O
- O
unlike O
Lee B-PER
Teng-hui I-PER
, O
who O
had O
fond O
memories O
of O
the O
colonial O
era O
. O

Tai B-PER
, O
who O
described O
himself O
as O
an O
" O
independent-minded O
Chinese B-MISC
born O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
" O
never O
lost O
his O
affection O
for O
China B-LOC
proper O
, O
and O
these O
sentiments O
set O
him O
apart O
from O
most O
historians O
of O
Taiwan B-LOC
. O

With O
regard O
to O
cross-strait O
relations O
, O
Tai B-PER
made O
his O
famous O
" O
testicles O
analogy O
. O
" O

Taiwan B-PER
is O
a O
part O
of O
China B-LOC

he O
stated O
, O
just O
as O
testicles O
are O
a O
part O
of O
a O
man O

Though O
inextricably O
linked O
to O
the O
body O
, O
the O
testicles O
have O
their O
own O
special O
functions O

He O
based O
his O
analogy O
on O
what O
he O
deemed O
was O
best O
for O
all O
of O
the O
Chinese B-MISC
people O
. O

His O
theory O
was O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
Lee B-PER
Teng-hui I-PER
's I-PER
belief O
that O
Taiwan B-LOC
should O
establish O
clear O
boundaries O
between O
itself O
and O
the O
mainland O
. O

But O
Tai B-PER
Kuo-hui I-PER
never O
shied O
from O
controversy O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
chosen O
to O
study O
Taiwanese B-MISC
history O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

Throughout O
his O
life O
, O
he O
maintained O
his O
tough O
Hakka B-MISC
spirit O
and O
academic O
independence O
, O
holding O
fast O
to O
his O
opinions O
and O
never O
compromising O

He O
was O
greatly O
admired O
for O
his O
intellectual O
integrity O
. O

These O
great O
masters O
' O
deaths O
have O
come O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
field O
of O

has O
been O
in O
the O

for O
other O
reasons O
. O

The B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG

has O
just O
formally O
apologized O

, O
and O
a O
university O
president O
has O
been O
found O
guilty O
of O
plagiarizing O
a O
research O

The O
former O
shows O
that O
intellectuals O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
need O
no O
longer O
fear O
torture O
and O
imprisonment O
for O
their O

The O

I O
wonder O
if O

jealous O
of O

I O
ask O
because O

of O
the B-MISC

They O
also O
recall O
that O
the O

those O

a O

by O

Yet O
, O
he O
may O
not O
know O
about O
Pali B-LOC

real O

, O
long O
in O
the O

The O
days O
of O

Pali B-LOC
was O
originally O
called O
Palifen B-LOC
, O
a O
transliteration O
of O
the O
place O
name O
used O
by O
the O
Ketagalan B-MISC
indigenous O
people O
. O

Located O
on O
the O
northwest O
corner O
of O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
Pali B-LOC
faces O
the B-MISC
Taiwan I-MISC
Strait I-MISC
to O
the O
northwest O
, O
rests O
against O
Mt. B-MISC
Kuanyin I-MISC
to O
the O
southeast O
, O
and O
looks O
across O
the O
river O
toward O
Tanshui B-LOC
to O
the O
northeast O
. O

Though O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
much O
of O
a O
hinterland O
, O
its O
geographic O
location O
has O
proved O
historically O
important O
, O
as O
one O
can O
see O
from O
the O
prehistoric O
cultures O
unearthed O
at O
the O
Ta B-MISC

pen I-MISC
- I-MISC
keng I-MISC
and O
Shih B-MISC
- I-MISC

archeological O
sites O
. O

Later O
, O
when O
Han B-MISC
Chinese I-MISC
began O
trickling O
across O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
they O
mainly O
settled O
along O
rivers O
. O

Because O
Pali B-LOC
is O
relatively O
close O
to O
the O
mainland O
and O
sits O
at O
the O
mouth O
of O
a O
river O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
natural O
harbor O
, O
in O
1757 B-MISC
the O
Qing B-MISC
court O
designated O
it O
to O
be O
one O
of O
Taiwan B-LOC
's O
small O
number O
of O
official O
ports O
for O
maritime O
transport O
with O
the O
mainland O
. O

Thus O
began O
an O
era O
in O
which O
great O
ships O
sailed O
in O
and O
out O
of O
Pali B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
silting O
and O
a O
destructive O
typhoon O
that O
struck O
in O
1796 B-MISC
, O
Pali B-LOC
began O
to O
give O
way O
in O
importance O
to O
Tanshui B-LOC
, O
located O
just O
across O
the O
river O
. O

Once O
mainly O
dependent O
on O
fishing O
, O
Pali B-LOC
increasingly O
came O
to O
rely O
on O
farming O
. O

But O
the O
hilly O
terrain O
and O
strong O
winds O
meant O
that O
there O
was O
little O
good O
land O
. O

While O
the O
hardy O
people O
of O
Pali B-LOC
barely O
kept O
their O
stomachs O
filled O
, O
their O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
left O
in O
search O
of O
a O
better O
life O
. O

Neither O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
occupation O
-LRB- O
which O
began O
in O
1895 B-MISC
-RRB- O
nor O
the O
return O
to O
Chinese B-MISC
rule O
-LRB- O
in O
1945 B-MISC
-RRB- O
brought O
much O
joy O
or O
change O
to O
this O
rural O
area O
. O

But O
in O
the B-MISC
1970s I-MISC
, O
urban O
planning O
came O
to O
Pali B-LOC
. O

It O
proved O
to O
be O
the O
prelude O
to O
a O
symphony O
-LRB- O
or O
perhaps O
cacophony O
-RRB- O
of O
transformation O
. O



Changing O
the O
rhythm O
of O
Pali B-LOC
life O

During O
the O
height O
of O
real O
estate O
speculation O
and O
soaring O
land O
prices O
in O
Taipei B-LOC
, O

put O

-LRB- O

in O

-RRB- O
one O

in O

Also O
, O
to O
try O
to O
reduce O
the O
outflow O
of O
population O
from O
Pali B-LOC
and O
to O
get O
the O
stagnant O
local O
economy O
moving O
, O
the O
government O
decided O
to O
link O
this O
formerly O
isolated O
village O
to O
the O
outside O
world O
. O

What O
had O
been O
Chungshan B-MISC
Road I-MISC
was O
turned O
into O
Provincial B-MISC
Highway I-MISC
#15 I-MISC
, O
and O
the O
opening O
of O
the B-MISC
Kuantu I-MISC
Bridge I-MISC
to O
traffic O
linked O
Pali B-LOC
directly O
to O
the O
busy O
Taipei B-LOC
districts O
of O
Shilin B-LOC
and O
Peitou B-LOC
. O

Gifted O
with O
a O
lovely O
setting O
between O
the O
mountains O
and O
the O
sea O
, O
Pali B-LOC
began O
to O
dream O
of O
a O
tourism O
boom O
. O

But O
fortune O
had O
other O
things O
in O
store O
. O

In O
order O
to O
pave O
the O
way O
for O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
water O
treatment O
facility O
on O
the O
northeast O
edge O
of O
Pali B-LOC
, O
the O
plan O
to O
develop O
tourism O
in O
Pali B-LOC
was O
scrapped O
overnight O
. O

The O
government O
, O
applying O
urban O
planning O
principles O
, O
zoned O
the O
area O
for O
residential O
and O
industrial O
use O
, O
in O
order O
to O
create O
a O
construction O
site O
for O
the O
facility O
. O

Then O
in O
1987 B-MISC
came O
the O
program O
to O
bring O
gravel O
from O
eastern O
to O
western O
Taiwan B-LOC
for O
construction O
purposes O
, O
and O
a O
harbor O
was O
built O
on O
the O
Pali B-LOC
coast O
for O
the O
convenience O
of O
gravel O
transporters O
. O

In O
accordance O
with O
the O
urban O
plan O
, O
new O
streets O
were O
cut O
this O
way O
and O
that O
through O
Pali B-LOC
's O
land O
, O
and O
high O
- O
rise O
buildings O
sprang O
up O
along O
the O
sides O
of O
these O
roadways O
. O

The O
sounds O
of O
backhoes O
at O
work O
resounded O
even O
from O
the O
black O
sand O
beaches O
. O

In O
1997 B-MISC
, O
the O
Hsiachuotzu B-LOC
garbage O
landfill O
formally O
opened O
, O
and O
it O
became O
common O
to O
see O
fleets O
of O
garbage O
trucks O
winding O
through O
the O
streets O
of O
Pali B-LOC
. O

This O
rural O
township O
, O
which O
was O
made O
responsible O
for O
storing O
the O
garbage O
from O
several O
communities O
in O
Taipei B-LOC
County I-LOC
, O
seemed O
resigned O
to O
the O
fate O
-LRB- O
suffered O
by O
many O
outlying O
areas O
-RRB- O
of O
having O
to O
choke O
on O
the O

It O
is O
only O
recently O
that O
the O
residents O
of O
Hsiachuotsu B-LOC
, O
unable O
to O
stand O
the O

, O
have O
begun O
to O
protest O

He O
can O
not O

sigh O

as O
he O
looks O
at O
the O

thinks O
of O
the O
dramatic O
changes O
that O
have O
come O
to O
this O

: O
" O
These O

have O
destroyed O

" O

It O

true O
that O
a O
lot O

thought O
they O
would O
get O
rich O
from O

But O
just O
because O

increases O
in O

does O
n't O
mean O
someone O
will O
buy O
it O
, O
and O
just O
because O
apartment O
complexes O
are O
built O
does O
n't O
mean O
there O
are O
people O
who O
want O
to O
live O
there O
. O

Worst O
of O
all O
, O
interpersonal O
relationships O
have O
been O
poisoned O
in O
the O
struggle O
over O
divvying O
up O
the O

because O
no O

how O

Lin B-PER

: O
" O
I O
am O
not O
by O
any O

But O
development O
is O
not O

the O

Can O
the O

All O

The O

The O

In O

As O
for O
the O

red O
cypress O
- O
merihi O
in O
Japanese B-MISC
- O
it O
is O
even O
more O

But O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
red O
cypress O

trunk O
is O
often O
divided O

and O
because O
it O
mostly O
grows O

prone O

The O
crown O
is O
also O
broad O

This O
is O
why O
the O
gigantic O
ancient O

that O

As O

, O
the O

in O
the B-MISC
Central I-MISC

in O
the O

their O
cypress O

The O
close O

their O

In O
the O
early O
days O
, O
the O

cut O

But O
tough O

the O

stood O
up O

three O

five O
years O

so O
there O
was O
no O

to O
change O
them O
all O
for O

false O

the O

hard O

, O

the O

before O

at O
Mt. B-MISC

Taiwan B-LOC

showed O
that O
there O
were O
more B-MISC
than I-MISC
300,000 I-MISC
false O

over B-MISC
1,000 I-MISC
years I-MISC

, O
but O
today O
all O
that O
remains O
of O

is O
a O
few O
lonely O

scattered O
among O

The O
TFB B-ORG
once O
hoped O

were O
left O
standing O
in O

they O
would O
seed O
naturally O

But O
they O
discovered O
that O
although O
the O

were O
completely O
uninjured O
, O
they O
died O
one O
by O
one O
. O

Late O
Taiwanese B-MISC

Liu B-PER
Chin I-PER
described O
these O
few O
remaining O

as O
" O
dying O
of O
loneliness O

" O

It O
seems O
that O
when O
abandoned O

the O

they O
had O
relied O
on O
for O
millennia O
, O
and O
left O
to O
face O
the O
rigors O

their O

alone O
, O
these O
ancient O

went O
into O
terminal O

But O
an O
even O
greater O
cause O
for O
regret O
is O
that O
" O
50 B-MISC

out O

At O
the O

time O
, O
however O
, O

candidate O
Chen B-PER

- I-PER
bian I-PER
captured O
only O
39 B-MISC
% I-MISC
of O
the O

, O
which O
translates O
to O
a O
weak O
mandate O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
he O
must O
take O
a O
moderate O
line O
that O
stresses O
inter-party O
cooperation O
. O

He O
will O
have O
to O
include O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
people O
in O
his O
government O
, O
keep O
a O
low O

temptation O

imperious O
in O

, O
and O
strive O

a O

all O

As O
for O
mainland O
China B-LOC

saber O
- O
rattling O
, O
Jin B-PER
argued O
that O
there O
is O
no O

Stated O
Jin B-PER
, O
" O
The O
consequences O

It O

not O
like O
Taiwan B-LOC

without O
any O

Are O
the O
mainland O

really O
prepared O
to O
see O
Hong B-LOC

Shanghai B-LOC
go O
up O
in O

? O
" O

There O
are O
other O
perspectives O
on O
cross-strait O

, O
of O
course O
. O

The O
seminar O
participants O
basically O
fell O
into O
three B-MISC
camps O
on O
future O
prospects O
. O

Some O
were O
highly O
optimistic O
, O
others O
were O
guardedly O
optimistic O
, O
and O
a O
third B-MISC
group O
argued O
that O
the O
crystal O
ball O
has O
gone O
cloudy O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
most O
optimistic O
view O
was O
expressed O
by O
Ruan B-PER
Ming I-PER
, O
a O
visiting O
professor O
at O
Tamkang B-ORG
University I-ORG
's I-ORG
Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
China I-ORG
Studies I-ORG
who O
in O
the O
1980s B-MISC
was O
an O
assistant O
to O
former O
Chinese B-MISC
Communist B-MISC
Secretary O
General O
Hu B-PER
Yaobang I-PER
. O

Ruan B-PER
stated O
that O
Beijing B-LOC
's O
basic O
position O
on O
Taiwan B-LOC
has O
not O
changed O
at O
all O
since O
the O
days O
of O
Deng B-PER
Xiaoping I-PER
. O

" O
There O
's O
nothing O
new O
in O
what O
they O
're O
saying O
. O
" O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
Chinese B-MISC
Communists B-MISC
are O
saying O
, O
says O
Ruan B-PER
, O
is O
that O
they O
will O
attack O
" O
if O
Taiwan B-LOC
makes O
any O
sort O
of O
formal O
move O
toward O
independence O
, O
" O
and O
Taiwan B-LOC
has O
no O
need O
to O
formalize O
anything O
because O
changing O
the O
country O
's O
name O
would O
be O
meaningless O
. O

" O
No O
matter O
what O
you O
call O
yourself O
, O
people O
are O
still O
going O
to O
call O
you O
Taiwan B-LOC
. O

It O
's O
just O
like O
in O
England B-LOC
- O
the O
official O
name O
is O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
Kingdom I-LOC
of I-LOC
Great I-LOC
Britain I-LOC
and I-LOC
Northern I-LOC
Ireland I-LOC
, O
but O
nobody O
calls O
it O
that O
. O

And O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
going O
around O
shouting O
, O
' O
We O
're O
a O
country O
! O
We O
're O
a O
country O
! O
' O

Who O
in O
the O
international O
community O
does O
that O
? O
" O



Pragmatism O
, O
please O

" O
Taiwan B-LOC
needs O
to O
be O
more O
pragmatic O
, O
" O
says O
Ruan B-PER
, O
" O
just O
like O
the O
mainland O
. O
" O

They O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
ahead O
of O
the O
election O
trying O
to O
sway O
votes O
, O
but O
once O
the O
election O
was O
over O
they O
backpedaled O
quickly O
with O
the O
simple O
statement O
, O
" O
We O
'll O
wait O
and O
see O
what O
they O
say O
and O
do O
. O
" O

The O
attitude O
with O
them O
, O
in O
Ruan B-PER
's O
view O
, O
is O
very O
pragmatic O
. O

Ruan B-PER
is O
optimistic O
about O
cross-strait O
relations O
under O
the O
new O
regime O
, O
and O
states O
, O
" O
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
is O
best O
positioned O
to O
improve O
cross-strait O
relations O
. O
" O

He O
likens O
Chen B-PER
to O
the O
staunchly O
anti-communist O
Richard B-PER
Nixon I-PER
, O
who O
was O
able O
to O
normalize O
ties O
with O
the B-MISC
Chinese I-MISC
Communists I-MISC
precisely O
because O
he O
was O
trusted O
by O
the O
American B-MISC
people O
. O

Similarly O
, O
when O
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
negotiates O
with O
Beijing B-LOC
, O
no O
one O
will O
worry O
about O
him O
selling O
Taiwan B-LOC
down O
the O
river O
. O

The O

Contemporary B-ORG

, O
agreed O
strongly O
with O
Ruan B-PER

comments O
, O
and O
added O
, O
" O
In O
this O
election O
the O
people O
of O

were O
even O
more O
concerned O
about O
domestic O

than O
they O
were O
about O
cross-strait O

" O

The O
most O

Chen B-PER

Virtually O
everyone O
at O

in O

neither O

He O
feels O
that O

" O

there O
has O

he O
listed O
a O

It O
is O
also O
true O
that O

who O

highly O

the O

And O
yes O
, O
once O
again O
, O
it O
is O
true O
that O
the B-MISC
Chinese I-MISC
Communists I-MISC
have O
muted O
their O
rhetoric O
considerably O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
two B-MISC
sides O
view O
each O
other O
with O
suspicion O
. O

If O
the B-MISC
Chinese I-MISC
Communists I-MISC
conclude O
that O
Taiwan B-LOC
's O
leadership O
has O
dropped O
its O
insistence O
on O
formal O
independence O
only O
to O
pursue O
a O
policy O
that O
includes O
de O

independence O
as O
its O
aim O
, O
Chou B-PER
argued O
that O
this O
will O
introduce O
a O
note O
of O
uncertainty O
into O
the O
relationship O
. O

Tseng B-PER
Fu I-PER
- I-PER
sheng I-PER
feels O
that O
Taiwan B-LOC
should O
claim O
the O
high O
ground O
by O
holding O
up O
its O
experience O
in O
democratization O
as O
an O
example O
for O
the B-MISC
Chinese I-MISC
Communists I-MISC
. O

Says O
Tseng O
, O
" O
Reunification O
depends O
entirely O
on O
whether O
China B-LOC
can O
democratize O
. O
" O

His O
biggest O
worry O
is O
that O
the O
deep O
gulf O
between O
the O
DPP B-ORG
and O
the O
mainland O
authorities O
could O
cause O
them O
to O
misread O
each O
other O
. O

He O
stressed O
that O
there O
are O
both O
doves O
and O
hawks O
on O
all O
sides O
of O
the O
trilateral O
relationship O
between O
Beijing B-LOC
, O
Washington B-LOC

and O

If O
the O
hawks O
gained O
the O
upper O
hand O
at O
the O

time O
in O
all O
three O

opined O

the O

herself O

argued O
that O
the O
protest O
revealed O
an O
ethnic O
fault O
line O
in O
Taiwanese B-MISC
society O
. O

It O
was O
a O
venting O
of O
mass O
frustration O
on O
the O
part O
of O
one O
particular O
ethnic O
group O
, O
said O
Ping B-PER
, O
noting O
that O
most O
of O
the O
protesters O
were O
mainlanders O
. O

This O
group O
feels O
a O
loss O
of O
status O
, O
for O
during O
the O
many O
decades O
of O
KMT B-ORG
rule O
they O
have O
always O
thought O
of O
themselves O
as O
a O
privileged O
" O
majority O
" O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
even O
though O
in O
fact O
they O
are O
a O
minority O
. O

They O
do O
not O
identify O
with O
Taiwan B-LOC
as O
their O
home O
, O
and O
they O
have O
an O
unconscious O
feeling O
of O
superiority O
vis O
- O
a O
- O
vis O
the O
local O
majority O
. O

In O
some O
ways O
the O
election O
has O
forced O
them O
to O
realize O
that O
they O
truly O
are O
a O
minority O
. O

This O
development O
should O
help O
to O
bring O
about O
long O

lasting O
ethnic O
harmony O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC

The O
participants O
generally O
felt O
that O
the O
election O
was O
a O
victory O
for O
democracy O
. O

On O
the O
domestic O
front O
, O
the O
victory O
of O
Chen B-PER

showed O
that O
people O
want O
more O
democracy O
, O
greater O

and O
a O
more O
serious O

from O

In O

Chen B-PER

spells O
the O
end O
of O

she O
sent O

Her O
ten B-MISC

old O

once O

The O
Hong B-LOC

elementary O
school O
and O
the O
international O
school O
are O
both O
an B-MISC
hour I-MISC
or I-MISC
two I-MISC
away O
from O
Dongguan B-LOC
, O
and O
many O
of O
the O
Taiwanese B-MISC
in O
Dongguan B-LOC
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
see O
their O
children O
every O
day O
. O

This O
prompted O
a O
group O
of O
them O
to O
establish O
a O
private O
bilingual O
school O
called O
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
in O
February B-MISC
1998 I-MISC
. O

The O
school O
admits O
children O
from O
kindergarten O
-LRB- O
age O
five B-MISC
-RRB- O
through O
grade O
five B-MISC
of O
elementary O
school O
. O

Some O
of O
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
's I-ORG
200 B-MISC
students O
-LRB- O
such O
as O
Norman B-PER
Hsu I-PER
's I-PER
child O
-RRB- O
used O
to O
go O
to O
school O
in O
Shenzhen B-LOC
, O
while O
others O
have O
transferred O
in O
from O
the O
mainland O
Chinese B-MISC
public O
school O
system O
. O

Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
is O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
Taiwanese B-MISC
school O
being O
promoted O
by O
the O
TBAD B-ORG
. O

Most O
of O
its O
teaching O
materials O
are O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
used O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
's O
elementary O
schools O
, O
and O
of O
the O
15 B-MISC
or O
so O
teachers O
there O
, O
three B-MISC
are O
from O
Taiwan B-LOC
. O

The O
big O
difference O
is O
that O
classes O
are O
taught O
in O
both O
Chinese B-MISC
and O
English B-MISC
because O
the O
Taiwanese B-MISC
parents O
are O
very O
interested O
in O
seeing O
that O
their O
children O
learn O
English B-MISC
well O
. O

According O
to O
Huang B-PER
Su I-PER
, O
executive O
director O
of O
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
, O
" O
A O
lot O
of O
parents O
keep O
after O
me O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
children O
's O
education O
is O
exactly O
like O
the O
regular O
system O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
remind O
them O
that O
once O
you O
've O
left O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
you O
're O
not O
regular O
any O
longer O
. O
" O

According O
to O
Huang B-PER
, O
making O
the O
school O
a O
mirror O
image O
of O
those O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
does O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O
you O
are O
running O
a O
good O
school O
. O

The O
key O
is O
to O
provide O
an O
education O
that O
meets O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
students O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Taiwanese B-MISC
teaching O
materials O
, O
she O
has O
also O
incorporated O
some O
materials O
from O
the O
mainland O
and O
overseas O
into O
the O
curriculum O
. O

Huang B-PER
Su I-PER
, O
who O
hails O
from O
Beijing B-LOC
, O
majored O
in O
English B-MISC
at O
university O
and O
is O
keenly O
interested O
in O
education O
. O

She O
came O
to O
Dongguan B-LOC
after O
marrying O
a O
Taiwanese B-MISC
expat O
there O
, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
Taiwanese B-MISC
business O
community O
that O
asked O
her O
to O
run O
a O
school O
. O

Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
now O
has O
a O
very O
good O
reputation O
in O
the O
Taiwanese B-MISC
community O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
some O
Taiwanese B-MISC
send O
their O
children O
to O
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
from O
as O
far O
away O
as O
Zhuhai B-LOC

just O
opposite O
Macau B-LOC
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Pearl B-MISC
River I-MISC

-RRB- O
. O

Huang B-PER
has O
been O
deeply O
impressed O
by O
the O
deep O
concern O
that O
Taiwanese B-MISC
parents O
show O
for O
their O
children O
's O
education O
in O
the O
face O
of O
difficulties O
posed O
by O
living O
away O
from O
their O
native O
Taiwan B-LOC
. O

One B-MISC
parent O
, O
for O
example O
, O
practically O
begged O
her O
to O
admit O
his O
six B-MISC
- I-MISC
year I-MISC
old O
child O
, O
explaining O
, O
" O
He O
's O
never O
had O
any O
playmates O
. O

The O
only O
people O
he O
's O
ever O
been O
with O
are O
his O
nanny O
and O
some O
employees O
from O
the O
plant O
. O
" O

The O
Taiwanese B-MISC
kids O
at O
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
come O
from O
many O
different O
backgrounds O
. O

Some O
speak O
in O
a O
mixture O
of O
Chinese B-MISC
and O
English B-MISC
, O
while O
others O
speak O
and O
look O
just O
like O
any O
mainland O
Chinese B-MISC
child O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
have O
transferred O
in O
and O
out O
of O
lots O
of O
different O
schools O
in O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
States I-LOC

Taiwan B-LOC

and O
the O

. O

There O
is O
no O
trace O
of O
the O
world O
's O
cares O
on O
their O
faces O
though O
; O
the O
thing O
they O
're O
most O
concerned O
about O
is O
studying O
a O
little O
less O
and O
playing O
a O
little O
more O
. O

One O
bespectacled O
child O
laments O
, O
" O
School O
is O
better O
in O
Canada B-LOC
because O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
do O
so O
much O
homework O

There O
's O
too O
much O
homework O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC

the O

It O

no O

" O

An O
older O

, O
it O
turns O
out O

have O
both O
lived O
overseas O

Huang B-PER
stays O
in O
close O
touch O
with O
the O
Taiwanese B-MISC
parents O
. O

Their O
children O
enjoy O
very O
comfortable O
homes O
and O
seem O
to O
have O
experienced O
much O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
the O
biggest O
problem O
is O
that O
" O
they O
are O
n't O
motivated O
and O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
they O
should O
need O
to O
study O
. O
" O

Another O
problem O
for O
the O
school O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
interesting O
things O
to O
do O
in O
Dongguan B-LOC
. O

Unless O
teachers O
are O
very O
devoted O
to O

, O
they O
are O
not O
likely O
to O
stay O
there O
long O
. O

" O
It O
's O
all O
the O
more O
difficult O
, O
" O
notes O
Huang B-PER
frankly O
, O
" O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
teachers O

who O

compare O
their O
situation O
here O
with O
what O
they O
are O
accustomed O
to O
in O

" O

The O
Taiwanese B-MISC

will O
be O
faced O

the O

why O
should O
the O

wish O
to O

for O

? O

Sylvia B-PER
Yang I-PER
points O
out O
that O
Little B-ORG

a O
private O

even O

NT$ O
160,000 B-MISC

per O

, O
more O
than O
many O
Taiwanese B-MISC
parents O
can O
pay O
. O

Says O
H. B-PER
D. I-PER
Ye I-PER
, O
" O
We O
would O
like O
to O
get O
funding O
from O
both O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC

authorities O
to O

down O

" O

Although O
the O
cornerstone O
has O
already O
been O
laid O
, O
Ye B-PER
reports O
that O
not O
enough O
funds O
have O
been O
raised O
, O
nor O
have O
all O
the O
teachers O
been O
hired O
. O

Although O
the O
picture O
generally O
looks O
pretty O
good O
, O
there O
is O
still O
much O
work O
to O
be O
done O
. O

Expenses O
for O

expected O
to O

and O
only O
about O
NT$ B-MISC
20 I-MISC

been O
raised O
so O
far O
. O

Ye B-PER
often O
speaks O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
on O
the O
topic O
of O
investing O
in O
the O
mainland O
, O
something O
which O
he O
knows O
a O
lot O
about O

Says O
Ye B-PER
jokingly O
, O
" O
I O
jack O
up O
my O
speaking O
fees O
to O
make O
extra O
money O
for O
the O
school O
. O
" O

The O
TBAD B-ORG
is O
now O
considering O
funding O
the O
school O
through O
an O
endowment O
, O
shares O
in O
which O
would O
be O
sold O
to O
business O

. O

The O
location O
for O
the O
school O
has O
already O
been O
selected O
. O

It O
is O
a O
large O
site O
in O
the O
township O
of O
Zhongtang B-LOC

The O
lot O
is O
basically O
empty O
right O
now O
, O
but O
the O
roar O
of O
excavators O
fills O
the O
air O
, O
and O
the O
steel O
piles O
have O
already O
been O
driven O
. O

The O
school O
grounds O
are O
located O
next O
to O
the O
ancient O
Beidi B-MISC
Temple I-MISC
, O
which O
is O
shaded O
by O
the O
leaves O
of O
a O
spreading O
banyan O

On O
the O
temple O
gate O
a O
fading O
couplet O
reads O
: O
" O
He O
who O
is O
truly O

become O
a O

no O

he O
may O

. O
" O

The O
locals O
must O
have O
taken O
this O
message O
to O
heart O
over O
the O
years O

because O
it O
is O
said O
that O

from O
Zhongtang B-LOC
often O
took O
the O
top O
spot O
in O
the O
imperial O
examinations O
of O
centuries O
past O

It O
is O
very O
gratifying O
that O
a O
place O
like O
Dongguan B-LOC

with O
its O
abundant O
business O
opportunities O
, O
should O
also O
have O

Mr. O
Hassan B-PER
Nasrallah I-PER
talked O
about O
outside O
support O
for O
the O
government O
. O

The O
government O
claims O
that O
there O
is O
no O
outside O
influence O
on O
its O
decisions O
, O
while O
the O
West B-LOC
says O
that O
the O
Lebanese B-MISC
government O
is O
a O
Western B-MISC
project O
. O

How O
do O
you O
read O
this O
equation O
? O

Regardless O
of O
what O
the O
Lebanese B-MISC
government O
says O
, O
there O
are O
obvious O
positions O
from O
Israel B-LOC
and O
from O
the O
new O
conservatives O
in O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
of I-LOC
America I-LOC
. O

Yes O
. O

They O
use O
the O
state O
of O
internal O
contradiction O
in O
Lebanon B-LOC
regarding O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
authority O
and O
regarding O
the O
management O
of O
the O
authority O
in O
the O
country O
as O
an O
entrance O
and O
a O
means O
to O
justify O
the O
attack O
on O
the O
region O
and O
to O
justify O
the O
scheme O
of O
the O
neo-conservatives O
, O
who O
suffered O
several O
failures O
and O
kept O
falling O
, O
one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
inside O
America B-LOC
. O

So O
you O
find O
that O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
re-fix O
and O
produce O
their O
project O
in O
the O
region O
, O
maybe O
it O
would O
reflect O
on O
the O
American B-MISC
inside O
, O
and O
to O
abort O
ah O
ah O
the O
report O
of O
the B-ORG
Baker I-ORG
- I-ORG
Hamilton I-ORG
commission I-ORG
, O
which O
appeared O
yesterday O
and O
which O
carries O
in O
its O
pages O
a O
project O
opposing O
a O
project O
of O
the O
neo-conservatives O
. O

<1542.5365:1543.099> O
Ah O
-- O

Yes O
. O

So O
, O
this O
plan O
is O
obvious O
that O
using O
the O
Lebanese B-MISC
front O
, O
and O
using O
the O
position O
of O
the O
Lebanese B-MISC
government O
, O
whether O
it O
wanted O
or O
not O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
serving O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
foreigner O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
can O
we O
say O
that O
the O
insistence O
, O
of O
the O
governing O
team O
not O
to O
step O
down O
, O
the O
reason O
for O
it O
is O
not O
the O
strength O
of O
its O
position O
, O
but O
the O
outside O
support O
for O
it O
? O

It O
is O
obvious O
to O
you O
this O
issue O
has O
become O
obvious O
for O
everyone O
, O
especially O
after O
some O
Arab B-MISC
countries O
entered O
the O
battlefield O
in O
Lebanon B-LOC
in O
an O
obvious O
way O
, O
and O
they O
considered O
themselves O
the O
concerned O
party O
with O
that O
struggle O
and O
threat O
by O
sending O
troops O
to O
Lebanon B-LOC
to O
fight O
in O
defense O
of O
that O
situation O
. O

We O
consider O
that O
heating O
up O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Lebanese B-MISC
government O
, O
especially O
that O
the O
will O
of O
the O
opposition O
is O
heading O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
creating O
a O
slogan O
under O
the O
headline O
of O
a B-ORG
Coalition I-ORG
Government I-ORG
. O

Yes O
. O

The O
intention O
is O
not O
to O
exclude O
anyone O
, O
neither O
to O
isolate O
anyone O
. O

The O
intention O
is O
to O
form O
a O
state O
of O
national O
participation O
to O
protect O
the O
main O
principles O
and O
the O
national O
strategy O
in O
the O
country O

This O
means O
that O
this O

Siniora B-PER

visit O
, O
has O
special O
significance O
, O
and O
that O
he O

Russia B-LOC

has O
not O
distanced O
itself O
from O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
Lebanese B-MISC
issue O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
had O
a O
clear O

all O
the O

went O

Yes O

You O
also O
know O

, O
that O

a O
clear O
position O
in O
the O
the O
latest O

, O
uh O
, O
pertaining O
to O
the O
international O
tribunal O
. O

And O
it O
was O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
, O
uh O
, O
converging O
with O
the O
position O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
of O
the O
opposition O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O

or O
the O
majority O
, O
the O
so O

called O
majority O
in O
this O

It O
stood O
for O
not O
letting O
this O

constitute O
a O
schism O
in O
the O
Lebanese B-MISC
national O
unity O
on O
one O
hand O

Mr. O
Sha'er B-PER
ah O
what O
justifies O
the O
refusal O
ah O
ah O
of O
your O
government O
to O
attend O
the O
speech O
by O
President O
Mahmoud B-PER
Abbas I-PER
tomorrow O
, O
and O
it O
is O
assumed O
to O
be O
a O
speech O
that O
interests O
all O
Palestinians B-MISC
, O
with O
all O
factions O
? O

No O
, O
we O
are O
not O
the O
concerned O
with O
%pw O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

This O
is O
a O
speech O
the O
President O
gives O
to O
the O
Palestinian B-MISC
people O
, O
he O
wants O
to O
present O
his O
point O
of O
view O
on O
the O
subject O
. O

We O
are O
not O
part O
of O
this O
subject O
ah O
and O
we O
are O
not O
part O
of O
this O
speech O
he O
will O
give O
. O

It O
is O
a O
point O
of O
view O
the O
President O
sees O
and O
wants O
to O
give O
. O

Since O
we O
are O
not O
partners O
in O
this O
speech O
, O
so O
would O
we O
just O
be O
an O
esteemed O
listener O
in O
such O
a O
meeting O
? O

Besides O
the O
very O
difficult O
, O
intense O
security O
state O
that O
we O
urge O
the O
President O
and O
all O
the O
parties O
in O
the O
Palestinian B-MISC
street O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
this O
chaos O
and O
this O
breakdown O
in O
security O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
not O
in O
a O
speech O
here O
or O
there O
, O
but O
we O
are O
absolutely O
convinced O
that O
speeches O
and O
lots O
of O
speeches O
in O
the O
Palestinian B-MISC
street O
have O
come O
to O
complicate O
the O
situation O
, O
and O
we O
fear O
that O
these O
speeches O
ah O
could O
increase O
the O
tension O
in O
the O
situation O
. O

This O
was O
a O
topic O
of O
conversation O
today O
between O
me O
and O
the O
President O
, O
and O
I O
told O
him O
that O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
such O
speeches O
ah O
will O
bring O
interpretations O
, O
responses O
, O
and O
reactions O
, O
then O
they O
might O
be O
interpreted O
in O
the O
street O
into O
bullets O
; O
we O
do O
not O
need O
that O
. O

We O
want O
a O
government O
, O
we O
want O
national O
unity O
, O
we O
want O
to O
heal O
the O
injuries O
, O
we O
want O
a O
good O
word O
, O
not O
a O
list O
of O
grievances O
now O
. O

Before O
we O
talk O
about O
a O
list O
of O

, O
we O
first O
want O
to O
calm O
down O
the O
Palestinian B-MISC
public O

of O
all O

Ok O

The O

in O

this O
is O
a O

However O

at O

it O
was O

, O
an O
old O
rate O
, O
uh O
, O
before O
the O
rate O
of O
the O
dinar O
increased O
or O
was O
at O
today O
's O
exchange O
rate O
. O

People O
's O
economic O
standard O
rose O
over O
the B-MISC
past I-MISC
three I-MISC
or I-MISC
four I-MISC
years I-MISC
, O
and O
consequently O
, O
we O
must O
reconsider O
, O
since O
the O
law O
includes O
a O
review O
of O
the O
leases O
. O

The O
other O
side O
sees O
, O
and O
this O
was O
our O
point O
of O
view O
really O
, O
that O
the O
economic O
situation O
today O
in O
Iraq O
is O
a O
deplorable O
situation O
. O

According O
to O
the O
official O
statistics O
that O
the O
Iraqi B-MISC
state O
has O
, O
about O
40 B-MISC
percent I-MISC
of O
the O
people O
are O
at O
or O
below O
the O
poverty O
line O
, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
very O
high O
proportion O
. O

Therefore O
, O
these O
people O
do O
not O
have O
the O
capabilities O
of O
paying O
I O
mean O
, O
high O
rental O
fees O
. O

There O
has O
to O
be O
sufficient O
protection O
for O
him O
by O
the O
state O
. O

Housing O
projects O
have O
to O
be O
provided O
by O
the O
state O
to O
the O
weak O
, O
incapable O
social O
classes O
. O

These O
projects O
have O
not O
been O
provided O
so O
far O
. O

Uh O
, O
and O
there O
is O
also O
another O
problem O
that O
was O
recently O
added O
, O
which O
is O
the O
problem O
of O
sectarian O
criminal O
displacement O

The O
most O

thing O
about O

that O
it O

The O

No O

We O
took O
a O

On O

the O

an O

according O

That O

You O

, O
there O
are O

Ah O
, O
the O
most O
special O
is O
rice O

a O
major O

As O
a O
result O
, O
three B-MISC
different O

were O
built O
in O
Hong B-MISC

These O
have O
become O
the O
best O

Among O
common O

, O
a O
rather O
special O
one O
is O

It O
is O
an O

there O

, O
however O
, O
each O

about O
two B-MISC

three I-MISC

Why O

Because O

, O
our O

They O
add O

Without O

A O
dream O
that O
has O
been O
anticipated O
for O
more B-MISC
than I-MISC
twenty I-MISC
years I-MISC
will O
soon O
come O
true O
here O
. O

Because O
your O
line O
connects O

with O
two B-MISC

In O
recent B-MISC
years I-MISC
, O
Hong B-LOC

have O
gradually O
moved O
from O

Two B-MISC

Year I-MISC
are O
located O
on O
Lantau B-MISC
Island I-MISC
of O
the B-LOC
New I-LOC
Territory I-LOC
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
Lantau B-MISC
Island I-MISC
has O
become O
a O
new O
Hong B-LOC
Kong I-LOC
tourism O
popular O
spot O
. O

The O
earliest O
to O
settle O

was O
this O
world O

largest O
outdoor O

In O
Chinese B-MISC

there O
are O

, O

, O
south O
, O
north O
, O
and O

- O
and O
five B-MISC

Therefore O

Hong B-LOC

exist O
as O
the O

for O
each O
of O
the O

As O
a O
result O
, O
this O
place O
has O
become O
holy O
land O
in O
the O
hearts O
of O
male O
and O
female O

. O

However O
, O
to O
common O
tourists O
, O
more O
of O
what O
this O
place O
brings O
them O
is O
wonder O
and O
awe O
. O

Since O
this O

The O
important O
status O
of O
Lantau B-MISC

is O
increasingly O
apparent O
. O



No O
, O
it O
was O
totally O

in O
the O

In O
the O

also O
begin O
on O
a O
cross-sea O

the O

It O

extremely O
troublesome O
to O

One O

For O

a O

boldly O
made O
a O

proposal O

With O
this O

, O
the O
distance O
would O
be O
very O
small O
, O
only O
a B-MISC
little I-MISC
over I-MISC
one I-MISC

. O

However O
, O
due O
to O
various O
reasons O
, O
bridge O
construction O
was O
put O
off O
. O

This O
is O
what O
we O
have O
seen O
since O
1999 B-MISC

Anticipated O
for O
20 B-MISC
years I-MISC
, O
today O
this O
dream O
is O
finally O

Well O
, O
originally O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
new O
-- O

With O
this O
new O
Hong O

- O
Zhuhai B-LOC
- O
Macao O
bridge O
that O
basically O
leads O
to O
all O
three B-LOC
places O
, O
Hong B-LOC
Kong I-LOC
, O
Macao B-LOC
, O
and O
Zhuhai B-LOC
, O
basically O
, O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
bridge O
, O
you O
can O
get O
on O
the O
separate O
road O
to O
the O
place O
you O
want O
to O
go O
. O

Macao B-LOC
is O
this O
way O
, O
and O
Zhuhai B-LOC
is O
this O
way O
. O

From O
the O
perspective O
of O
either O
Hong B-LOC

, O
Macao B-LOC
, O
or O
Zhuhai B-LOC
, O
our O
concept O
is O
a O

Er O
, O
%pw O
Zhuhai B-LOC
for O

we O

Each O
place O
has O

, O
with O
this O

when O
some O

, O
friends O
from O
mainland O

it O

no O

this O
is O
the O
first B-MISC
time O
I O
've O
seen O
you O
, O
and O
I O
've O
always O
wanted O
to O
ask O
you O
a O
question O
. O

Ah O
. O

Usually O
directors O
, O
otherwise O
, O
they O
have O
beards O
and O
very O
long O
hair O
, O
or O
otherwise O
they O
shave O
their O
heads O
. O

Oh O
. O

Oh O
! O
I O
had O
n't O
thought O
about O
that O
. O

Actually O
a O
shaved O
head O
is O
really O
hard O
to O
manage O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
? O

Do O
you O
have O
to O
shave O
it O
every O
day O
? O

Right O
, O
yes O
. O

Um O
, O
when O
I O
've O
slept O
so O
much O
I O
ca O
n't O
wake O
up O
, O
I O
just O
shave O
my O
head O
and O
I O
'm O
awake O
. O

And O
do O
you O
need O
to O
polish O
it O
somehow O
? O

Then O
do O
you O
rub O
a O
little O
oil O
of O
some O
kind O
on O
it O
? O

Oh O
, O
after O
I O
shave O
it O
I O
rub O
on O
a O
little O
oil O
. O

Is O
it O
cold O
in O
the O
winter O
? O

Pretty O
cold O
. O

Do O
you O
wear O
a O
hat O
? O

In O
the O
winter O
? O

It O
forces O
me O
to O
wear O
a O
hat O
. O

That O
's O
a O
question O
I O
've O
always O
wanted O
to O
ask O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
that O
there O
are O
many O
people O
when O
they O
introduce O
you O
, O
aside O
from O
saying O
Director O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
who O
has O
shot O
such O
and O
such O
, O
they O
ca O
n't O
avoid O
the O
cliche O
, O
they O
always O
have O
to O
say O
" O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
introduce O
Marshall O
Ye B-PER
Ting I-PER
's O
grandson O
. O
" O

Your O
father O
, O
Ye B-PER
Zhengming I-PER
, O
was O
Marshall O
Ye B-PER
Ting I-PER
's O
second B-MISC
child O
. O

Right O
. O

Oh O
! O

But O
today B-MISC
we O
're O
telling O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
's I-PER
story O
. O

Let O
's O
start O
with O
when O
you O
were O
young O
. O

When O
you O
were O
young O
you O
were O
very O
naughty O
. O

Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
was O
born O
in O
Changchun B-LOC
in O
1958 B-MISC
. O

Although O
by O
that O
time O
his O
grandfather O
Ye B-PER
Ting I-PER
had O
been O
dead O
for O
12 B-MISC
years I-MISC
, O
the O
Ye B-PER
family O
maintained O
its O
status O
as O
a O
highly O
esteemed O
Communist B-MISC
household O
. O

The B-MISC
next I-MISC
year I-MISC
the O
entire O
family O
transferred O
to O
Beijing B-LOC
, O
and O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
spent O
his O
childhood O
there O
. O

He O
and O
his O
little O
friends O
went O
fishing O
, O
raised O
dogs O
, O
hunted O
sparrows O
, O
chased O
ducks O
, O
and O
many B-MISC
years I-MISC
later O
these O
supremely O
happy O
memories O
are O
all O
preserved O
in O
his O
movies O
and O
plays O
. O

One B-MISC
, O
two B-MISC
, O
three B-MISC
, O
four B-MISC
. O

Ducks O
were O
the O
most O
precious O
asset O
in O
our O
village O
. O

The O
village O
mayor O
gave O
them O
all O
to O
me O
. O

The O
mayor O
said O
to O
me O
, O
there O
are O
eighty B-MISC
- I-MISC
six I-MISC
in O
all O
; O

he O
had O
me O
check O
to O
see O
that O
there O
were O
none O
missing O
. O

But O
I O
never O
did O
count O
them O
all O
carefully O
. O

Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
's I-PER
mother O
, O
An B-PER
Qi I-PER
, O
was O
an O
educated O
woman O
who O
worked O
at O
the B-ORG
Changchun I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Studio I-ORG
. O

And O
his O
father O
, O
Ye B-PER
Zhengming I-PER
, O
was O
an O
outstanding O
son O
of O
the O
revolution O
. O

Because O
after O
the B-MISC
Wannan I-MISC
Incident I-MISC
Ye B-PER
Zhengming I-PER
and O
his O
father O
Ye B-PER
Ting I-PER
were O
imprisoned O
for O
two B-MISC
years I-MISC
in O
a O
Kuomnintang B-ORG
prison O
. O

But O
then O
, O
and O
for O
the O
same O
reasons O
, O
just O
after O
the B-MISC
Cultural I-MISC
Revolution I-MISC
started O
, O
Ye B-PER
Zhengming I-PER
was O
treated O
as O
a O
major O
capitalist O
roader O
. O

That O
year O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
was O
just O
eight B-MISC
years I-MISC
old O
. O

His O
family O
's O
sudden O
misfortune O
left O
the O
young O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
with O
very O
disturbing O
memories O
. O

He O
changed O
from O
a O
very O
well O
- O
behaved O
child O
into O
a O
naughty O
child O
. O

From O
that O
time O
on O
he O
often O
did O
things O
that O
went O
beyond O
the O
norm O
, O
sometimes O
to O
protect O
himself O
and O
sometimes O
to O
take O
care O
of O
his O
family O
. O

Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
just O
corrected O
us O
; O
he O
said O
that O
Ye B-PER
Ting I-PER
should O
not O
be O
called O
Marshal O
Ye B-PER
Ting I-PER
but O
rather O
General O
Ye B-PER
Ting I-PER
. O

Right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
General O
Ye B-PER
Ting I-PER
. O

Why O
, O
is O
there O
a O
big O
difference O
between O
marshal O
and O
general O
? O

Um O
, O
he O
died O
in O
'46 B-MISC
. O

That O
marshal O
, O
afterward O
, O
after O
Liberation B-MISC
, O
um O
, O
it O
was O
conferred O
on O
him O
, O
so O
only O
then O
-- O

OK O
, O
we O
'll O
call O
him O
General O
Ye B-PER
Ting I-PER
. O

Mm O
. O



Because O
, O

Very O
naughty O
? O

To O
what O
extent O
were O
you O
naughty O
then O
? O

In O
fact O
I O
was O
a O
very O
well O
- O
behaved O
child O
. O

But O
I O
was O
, O
forced O
into O
it O
, O
, O
if O
you O
were O
n't O
naughty O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
survive O
. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
forced O
into O
it O
? O

During O
the B-MISC
Cultural I-MISC
Revolution I-MISC
, O
, O
um O
, O
my O
family O
was O
considered O
capitalist O
roaders O
. O

So O
the O
kids O
then O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
with O
you O
, O
or O
they O
would O
tease O
you O
, O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
you O
always O
had O
to O
be O
fighting O
with O
people O
, O
such O
things O
, O

Why O
was O
that O
? O

Was O
it O
because O
people O
for O
example O
would O
say O
that O
your O
father O
was O
such O
and O
such O
, O
or O
your O
family O
was O
such O
and O
such O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
it O
was O
because O
of O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
? O

Right O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
it O
was O
like O
that O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

Because O
you O
had O
to O
face O
them O
alone O
, O
OK O
, O
a O
dozen B-MISC
people O
who O
wanted O
to O
fight O
you O
. O

You O
had O
to O
show O
your O
stuff O
right O
off O
the O
bat O
, O
and O
you O
had O
to O
be O
tough O
. O

So O
that O
was O
, O
the O
only O
way O
you O
could O
overcome O
them O
and O
get O
the O
upper O
hand O
. O

Mm O
. O

Were O
you O
tough O
? O

Mm O
. O

Very O
tough O
. O

Tough O
enough O
to O
-- O

Because O
, O
there O
was O
no O
way O
, O
if O
you O
were O
n't O
tough O
that O
was O
it O
, O
, O
how O
could O
you O
manage O
. O

You O
were O
the O
son O
of O
capitalist O
roaders O
, O
, O
you O
thought O
it O
was O
natural O
to O
be O
the O
object O
of O
bullying O
, O
and O
it O
's O
perfectly O
normal O
. O

Mm O
. O

, O
I O
remember O
one O
time O
, O
we O
were O
digging O
out O
an O
air O
- O
raid O
shelter O
, O
that O
-- O

Those O
, O
good O
kids O
, O
they O
went O
there O
and O
threw O
stones O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
dare O
defend O
myself O
, O
so O
I O
just O
had O
to O
endure O
it O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
. O

Mm O
. O

Finally O
a O
very O
big O
rock O
, O
a O
lump O
of O
earth O
, O
hit O
me O
on O
the O
head O
, O
And O
I O
got O
angry O
, O
so O
angry O
that O
I O
rushed O
out O
with O
a O
shovel O
and O
hit O
them O
with O
the O
shovel O
. O

Where O
did O
the O
shovel O
come O
from O
? O

From O
digging O
the O
air O
- O
raid O
shelter O
, O
it O
was O
there O
, O
right O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
you O
picked O
up O
the O
shovel O
and O
rushed O
them O
. O

Did O
you O
crack O
somebody O
's O
head O
open O
? O

Mm O
, O
anyhow O
, O
yes O
, O
I O
cracked O
their O
head O
open O
, O
it O
was O
very O
tragic O
. O

All O
of O
a O
sudden O
nobody O
was O
making O
a O
sound O
. O

Very O
-- O

Once O
I O
fought O
back O
, O
for O
several B-MISC
years I-MISC
after O
nobody O
dared O
mess O
with O
me O
. O

How O
many O
of O
them O
did O
you O
take O
out O
? O

I O
hit O
one O
of O
them O
and O
that O
was O
enough O
. O

Nopbody O
went O
to O
get O
the O
schoolmaster O
or O
somebody O
's O
father O
? O

They O
did O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
huge O
fuss O
. O

Mm O
. O

Because O
when O
I O
was O
little O
, O
having O
a O
big O
fight O
like O
that O
. O

Mm O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
more O
or O
less O
, O
, O
on O
average O
, O
every O
two B-MISC
years O
I O
changed O
school O
, O
and O
that O
's O
how O
it O
had O
to O
be O
. O

Mm O
. O

I O
remember O
one O
time O
-- O
Mm O
, O
also O
, O
when O
I O
was O
in O
fifth B-MISC
or O
sixth B-MISC
grade O
, O
someone O
yelled O
out O
, O
Down O
with O
Ye B-PER
Zhengming I-PER
, O
he O
was O
yelling O
at O
me O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
fight O
them O
. O

Mm O
. O

After O
the O
fight O
I O
went O
home O
, O
and O
my O
father O
was O
standing O
far O
away O
. O

, O
the O
factory O
, O
, O
on O
the O
street O
, O
somebody O
had O
written O
in O
huge O
letters O
Down O
with O
Ye B-PER
Zhengming I-PER
, O
, O
the O
slogan O
. O

Mm O
. O

I O
got O
accustomed O
to O
it O
while O
passing O
by O
at O
that O
time O
, O
and O
now O
when O
I O
think O
about O
it O
, O
it O
seems O
very O
much O
like O
a O
stage O
play O
. O

Mm O
. O

Back O
then O
I O
felt O
, O
looking O
at O
him O
standing O
so O
far O
away O
-- O

I O
walked O
over O
to O
him O
, O
and O
he O
said O
, O
um O
, O
you O
really O
do O
n't O
understand O
anything O
. O

At O
the O
time O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
had O
a O
grievance O
. O

And O
I O
felt O
, O
I O
was O
fighting O
for O
you O
, O
the O
people O
were O
cursing O
you O
, O
and O
I O
was O
fighting O
them O
. O

In O
fact O
that O
's O
the O
way O
kids O
think O
. O

Mm O
. O

a I-MISC
Place I-MISC
Called I-MISC
Wangjiazhan I-MISC

Wangjiazhuang B-LOC
, O
right O
. O

This O
is O
obviously O
him O
as O
a O
boy O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
memory O
of O
his O
childhood O
life O
. O

Right O
. O

Right O

Which O
child O
is O
you O
. O

Is O
this O
child O

that O
child O
you O
? O

Actually O
we O
should O
be O
accurate O
; O
this O
child O
's O
experiences O
, O

So O
this O
child O
, O

Um O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
because O
once O
, O
I O

My O
father O
was O
denounced O
, O
and O
then O
the O
rebels O
took O
us O
, O
took O
that O
child O
to O
see O
. O

Mm O
. O

They O
denounced O
my O
father O
, O
so O
I O
was O
very O
indignant O
, O

They O
let O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
expose O
my O
father O
, O

Mm O
. O

Then O
the B-MISC
day I-MISC
after O
I O
took O
a O
kitchen O
knife O
and O
ran O
over O
to O
their O
home O
, O
that O

, O
the O

and O
vowed O
that O
I O

the O
guy O
up O
. O

A O
kitchen O
knife O
; O
a O
knife O
from O
your O

at O
home O
. O

Oh O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
a O
knife O
from O
my O
kitchen O
at O
home O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
standing O
there O
, O
lots O
of O
people O
surrounding O
me O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
you O
ca O
n't O
just O
hack O
people O
up O
. O

But O
I O
had O
already O
said O
it O
. O

What O
did O
you O
say O
? O

said O
I O
have O
to O
hack O
him O
, O
have O
to O
hack O
, O
so O
it O
was O
more O
or O
less O
like O
this O
child O
. O

But O
, O
those O
adults O
standing O
around O
reasoned O
with O
me O
, O
said O
look O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
this O
. O

If O
you O
do O
this O
, O
you O
'll O
stir O
up O
more O
trouble O
, O
and O
then O
wo O
n't O
your O
dad O
be O
even O
worse O
off O
? O

In O
fact O
when O
they O
said O
that O
, O
my O
mind O
had O
already O
eased O
. O

I O
could O
not O
lose O
the O
face O
this O
way O
, O
, O
So O
then O
I O
ran O
over O
and O
took O
a O
whack O
at O
the O
door O
, O
to O
get O
an O
excuse O
for O
myself O
. O

Was O
it O
all O
ruined O
? O
The O
door O
-- O

I O
slashed O
it O
twice O
. O

Um O
, O
was O
n't O
there O
any O
consequence O
? O

Mm O
, O
there O
was O
no O
consequence O
, O
, O
I O
just O
let O
the O
adults O
reason O
with O
me O
. O

Mm O
, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
memory O
from O
your O
childhood O
years O
. O

It O
, O
had O
a O
great O
influence O
on O
me O
. O

Including O
that O
village O
, O
that O
environment O
, O
it O
's O
all O
very O
familiar O
to O
you O
. O

More O
or O
less O
, O
very O
close O
to O
me O
, O
this O
is O
a O
novel O
of O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

, O
the O
reason O
I O
like O
it O
is O
because O
, O
um O
, O
it O
brings O
up O
lots O
of O
that O
kind O
of O
childhood O
memories O
. O

Mm O
, O
you O
spent O
a O
large O
part O
of O
your O
childhood O
in O
Beijing B-LOC
. O

What O
year O
was O
it O
that O
you O
moved O
to O
Shanghai B-LOC
? O

How O
old O
were O
you O
at O
that O
time O
? O

, O
In O
'69 B-MISC
I O
was O
11 B-MISC
years I-MISC
old O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
, O
well O
. O

In O
'69 B-MISC
at O
the O
age O
of O
11 B-MISC
you O
went O
from O
Beijing B-LOC
to O
Shanghai B-LOC
. O

Mm O
, O
your O
living O
environment O
changed O
, O
but O
perhaps O
that O
mischievousness O
had O
n't O
completely O
passed O
. O

Mm O
, O
as O
he O
puts O
it O
, O
looking O
at O
it O
now O
, O
some O
of O
the O
memories O
can O
be O
very O
painful O
, O
but O
it O
was O
pretty O
happy O
days O
. O

I O
went O
there O
every O
day O
and O
then O
they O
suspended O
classes O
, O
, O
so O
I O
could O
n't O
go O
to O
school O
, O
could O
n't O
go O
to O
class O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
, O
later O
I O
remember O
there O
was O
-- O
Mm O
. O
A O
guy O
in O
the O
engineering O
team O
, O
and O
he O
brought O
Quotations B-MISC
from I-MISC
Chairman I-MISC
Mao I-MISC
and O
said O
to O
me O
, O
He O
said O
, O
now O
take O
this O
, O
now O
take O
these O
Quotations B-MISC
from I-MISC
Chairman I-MISC
Mao I-MISC
and O
teach O
yourselves O
, O
and O
in O
the O
future O
you O
'll O
take O
up O
arms O
and O
teach O
yourselves O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
were O
very O
happy O
, O
very O
excited O
, O
because O
they O
were O
bringing O
back O
the O
college O
entrance O
exams O
, O
why O
were O
you O
feeling O
so O
depressed O
? O

Right O
, O
but O
the O
problem O
-- O

Because O
, O
I O
had O
never O
studied O
well O
, O



In O
1966 B-MISC
the B-MISC
Great I-MISC
Cultural I-MISC
Revolution I-MISC
came O
, O
and O
at O
that O
time O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
's I-PER
family O
moved O
from O
Beijing B-LOC
to O
Shanghai B-LOC
to O
live O
. O

His O
father O
Ye B-PER
Zhengming I-PER
was O
being O
criticized O
as O
a O
capitalist O
roader O
at O
the O
research O
institute O
, O
and O
the O
political O
situation O
was O
getting O
worse O
by O
the O
day O
. O

And O
the O
change O
of O
regions O
did O
nothing O
to O
change O
the O
violent O
nature O
of O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
's I-PER
life O
. O

He O
was O
still O
struggling O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
preserving O
justice O
. O

When O
you O
got O
to O
Shanghai B-LOC
the O
environment O
changed O
; O
did O
n't O
your O
whole O
person O
change O
? O

After O
I O
got O
to O
Shanghai B-LOC
, O
, O
settling O
into O
, O
, O
that O
, O

All O
that O
time O
, O
from O
'69 B-MISC
to O
'76 B-MISC
, O
I O
graduated O
from O
senior O
middle O
school O
, O
it O
all O
took O
place O
there O
. O

Mm O
. O

At O
that O
time O
in O
school O
, O
there O
were O
some O
special O
children O
, O
there O
was O
a O
special O
class O
, O
the O
better O
students O
, O
were O
you O
in O
that O
class O
? O

Right O
, O
right O
, O
, O
see O
, O
like O
study O
classes O
to O
educate O
good O
kids O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
people O
were O
in O
your O
class O
? O

Um O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
boys O
and O
girls O
who O
did O
not O
perform O
well O
, O
you O
could O
say O
they O
were O
little O
hooligans O
, O
they O
were O
all O
mixed O
in O
together O
in O
that O
class O
, O
and O
there O
were O
also O
some O
who O
had O
problems O
at O
home O
. O

Mm O
. O

All O
of O
them O
, O
and O
every O
day O
I O
went O
there O
, O
and O
the O
classes O
were O
suspended O
, O
, O
so O
they O
did O
n't O
let O
me O
go O
to O
school O
, O
did O
n't O
let O
me O
go O
to O
class O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
, O
afterward O
, O
I O
remember O
there O
was O
Mm O
. O
A O
guy O
in O
the O
engineering O
team O
, O
and O
he O
brought O
Quotations B-MISC
from I-MISC
Chairman I-MISC
Mao I-MISC
and O
said O
to O
me O
, O
He O
said O
, O
now O
take O
this O
, O
now O
take O
these O
Quotations B-MISC
from I-MISC
Chairman I-MISC
Mao I-MISC
and O
teach O
yourselves O
, O
and O
in O
the O
future O
you O
'll O
take O
up O
arms O
and O
teach O
yourselves O
. O

Lots O
of O
fun O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
I O
was O
with O
this O
group O
of O
kids O
all O
together O
, O
and O
everybody O
copied O
everybody O
else O
and O
it O
was O
even O
harder O
to O
study O
. O

In O
fact O
it O
was O
n't O
that O
we O
did O
n't O
study O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
, O

This O
class O
really O
helped O
me O
a O
lot O
, O
, O
sometimes O
in O
my O
life O
I O
think O
about O
this O
, O

Mm O
. O

That O
period O
was O
both O
a O
happy O
and O
a O
fun O
time O
. O

Because O
I O
was O
a O
good O
egg O
. O

In O
this O
I O
go O
against O
the O
grain O
. O

Um O
, O
the O
thing O
is O
, O
, O
they O
're O
all O
the O
same O
. O

If O
you O
're O
bad O
, O
you O
do O
what O
you O
want O
, O
and O
so O
, O
you O
're O
honest O
and O
so O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
be O
free O
. O

Plus O
when O
you O
yourself O
have O
already O
decided O
that O
you O
're O
a O
bad O
kid O
, O
then O
, O
you O
achieve O
a O
kind O
of O
liberation O
, O
and O
you O
're O
completely O
liberated O
and O
free O
. O

I O
think O
that O
-- O

Um O
, O
of O
course O
today B-MISC
we O
say O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
um O
, O
in O
that O
class O
of O
ours O
, O
they O
were O
n't O
all O
necessarily O
bad O
kids O
. O

Mm O
. O

They O
just O
were O
n't O
like O
normal O
kids O
. O

, O
it O
was O
like O
a O
brotherhood O
. O

Ah O
, O
and O
we O
did O
some O
things O
that O
were O
out O
of O
bounds O
. O

Mm O
, O
we O
helped O
each O
other O
. O

Very O
sincere O
, O
very O
sincere O
and O
good O
. O



When O
he O
was O
in O
that O
class O
, O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
received O
patient O
teaching O
every O
day O
. O

At O
that O
time O
he O
encountered O
the O
first B-MISC
love O
of O
his O
life O
that O
still O
remains O
fresh O
in O
his O
memory O
. O

This O
girl O
became O
the O
only O
light O
in O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
's I-PER
dark O
life O
for O
several B-MISC
years I-MISC
. O

In O
those O
days O
if O
a O
middle O
school O
student O
liked O
a O
fellow O
- O
student O
, O
how O
did O
he O
go O
about O
expressing O
that O
? O

Um O
. O

When O
I O
was O
a O
school O
kid O
, O
for O
example O
, O
Um O
, O
that O
girl O
, O
who O
ran O
the O
kitchen O
and O
was O
one O
of O
the O
better O
students O
in O
our O
class O
, O
I O
liked O
her O
. O

Mm O
. O

I O
always O
felt O
, O
um O
, O
she O
can O
, O
give O
you O
more O
on O
your O
plate O
, O
put O
more O
things O
on O
your O
plate O
for O
you O
to O
eat O
. O

And O
then O
the O
most O
obvious O
way O
was O
um O
, O
to O
go O
see O
a O
movie O
together O
. O

Mm O
. O

It O
was O
, O

So O
already O
you O
could O
-- O
Go O
see O
a O
movie O
; O
I O
thought O
, O

That O
was O
it O
, O
that O
was O
it O
. O

You O
just O
want O
to O
go O
see O
the O
movie O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
worry O
about O
holding O
hands O
or O
not O
, O
um O
, O
and O
that O
was O
great O
, O
-- O

So O
you O
went O
to O
the O
movies O
with O
this O
girl O
? O

Yes O
. O

Do O
you O
still O
remember O
what O
movies O
you O
saw O
? O

The B-MISC
Flower I-MISC
Girl I-MISC
. I-MISC

I O
still O
remember O
that O
now O
. O

Mm O
. O

She O
cried O
as O
hard O
as O
she O
could O
. O

So O
seeing O
The B-MISC
Flower I-MISC
Girl I-MISC
was O
the O
equivalent O
of O
seeing O
Titanic B-MISC
now O
. O

Oh O
, O
yes O
, O
yes O
, O
a O
bit O
, O
a O
bit O
, O
yes O
, O
all O
was O
ready O
, O
no O
cry O
. O

Yes O
, O
crying O
her O
eyes O
out O
, O
a O
big O
film O
like O
that O
. O

At O
the O
time O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
n't O
cry O
. O

But O
the O
people O
all O
around O
were O
crying O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
cry O
it O
would O
look O
bad O
. O

So O
then O
you O
cried O
. O

So O
then O
I O
thought O
, O
I O
should O
let O
my O
emotions O
go O
. O

Um O
, O
how O
was O
the O
girl O
, O
was O
she O
very O
pretty O
? O

, O
now O
I O
remember O
that O
she O
was O
very O
pretty O
, O
mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

She O
was O
a O
very O
good O
student O
. O

Ha O
ha O
, O
this O
-- O

How O
was O
it O
she O
liked O
you O
? O

At O
that O
time O
we O
did O
n't O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
if O
two B-MISC
people O
gave O
each O
other O
the O
eye O
and O
felt O
it O
was O
right O
, O
then O
, O

Gave O
each O
other O
the O
eye O
, O
while O
you O
were O
in O
the O
class O
you O
gave O
each O
other O
the O
eye O
. O

, O
so O
, O
when O
we O
were O
in O
class O
, O
for O
example O
you O
, O

I O
remember O
how O
it O
happened O
, O
yes O
. O

Um O
. O
When O
we O
went O
to O
class O
, O
in O
the O
classroom O
, O
it O
was O
all O
very O
chaotic O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
then O
, O
we O
'd O
each O
pick O
up O
a O
piece O
of O
chalk O
and O
toss O
the O
chalk O
back O
and O
forth O
. O
And O
throw O
spitballs O
. O

I O
threw O
it O
at O
someone O
else O
but O
missed O
, O
and O
it O
hit O
her O
. O

The O
result O
was O
that O
she O
turned O
her O
head O
to O
look O
. O

And O
she O
looked O
at O
you O
angrily O
. O

I O
thought O
, O
uh-oh O
, O
the O
expression O
in O
her O
eyes O
was O
like O
she O
would O
forgive O
you O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
feeling O
. O

I O
thought O
wow O
, O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
feeling O
. O

Mm O
. O

That O
's O
how O
it O
was O
, O
I O
should O
say O
. O

It O
was O
like O
that O
? O

Mm O
. O

Many B-MISC
years I-MISC
later O
, O
afterward O
, O
we O
graduated O
from O
senior O
middle O
school O
, O
and O
I O
was O
still O
going O
to O
see O
her O
. O

Mm O
. O

The O
-- O

, O
so O
we O
all O
took O
the O
exams O
for O
college O
, O
and O
things O
changed O
, O
right O
. O

You O
graduated O
from O

Graduated O

Mm O

female O
schoolmate O
went O
to O
the O
Shanghai B-LOC
suburbs O
to O
live O
and O
work O
. O

Right O
, O

, O
yes O
. O

Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
went O
to O
work O
in O
a O
factory O
; O
at O
that O
time O
your O
monthly O
wages O
were O
, O
forty B-MISC
- I-MISC
some I-MISC
yuan I-MISC
? O

Mm O
, O
when O
I O
started O
it O
was O
a O
technical O
school O
. O

Then O
at O
first B-MISC

um O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
money O

It O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
money O

In O
1976 B-MISC
, O
there O
were O
two B-MISC
happy O
events O
in O
the O
Ye B-PER
family O
. O

The O
first B-MISC
was O
that O
his O
father O
, O
Ye B-PER
Zhengming I-PER
, O
was O
released O
and O
reunited O
with O
his O
family O
that O
he O
had O
been O
separated O
from O
for O
three B-MISC
years I-MISC
. O

The O
second B-MISC
event O
was O
that O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
had O
his O
18th B-MISC
birthday O
and O
became O
an O
adult O
. O

With O
the O
turn O
for O
the O
better O
in O
his O
father O
's O
political O
circumstances O
, O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
left O
behind O
his O
violent O
life O
and O
changed O
suddenly O
, O
becoming O
more O
inward O
- O
looking O
. O

In O
1978 B-MISC
the O
big O
news O
was O
that O
the O
college O
entrance O
exams O
would O
be O
reinstated O
nationwide O
, O
and O
people O
of O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
's I-PER
age O
were O
thrilled O
. O

However O
, O
at O
this O
time O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
, O
facing O
this O
opportunity O
that O
would O
change O
his O
fortune O
, O
was O
at O
a O
loss O
as O
to O
what O
to O
do O
. O

You O
thought O
those O
days O
were O
pretty O
good O
, O
did O
you O
not O
think O
about O
getting O
into O
the O
university O
? O

Oh O
my O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
'78 B-MISC
, O
for O
me O
, O
was O
an O
especially O
depressing O
time O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

Up O
to O
then O
, O
um O
, O
I O
had O
never O
thought O
about O
the O
future O
. O

Mm O
. O

I O
thought O
everybody O
was O
the O
same O
, O
your O
fate O
settled O
things O
for O
you O
, O
um O
, O
you O
either O

became O
a O
-LRB- O
factory O
-RRB- O
worker O
. O

In O
society O
, O
being O
a O
worker O
was O
already O
not O
so O
bad O
a O
thing O
, O
um O
, O
a O
way O
to O
move O
ahead O
. O

Um O
, O
in O
'78 B-MISC
suddenly O
they O
reinstated O
the O
college O
entrance O
exams O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
in O
'78 B-MISC
, O
I O
was O
20 B-MISC
. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
were O
happy O
, O
very O
excited O
, O
because O
they O
reinstated O
the O
college O
entrance O
exams O
; O
why O
were O
you O
feeling O
depressed O
? O

Right O
, O
but O
the O
problem O
was O
, O
, O
Because O
, O
I O
had O
never O
done O
well O
in O
school O
. O

So O
right O
off O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
finished O
, O
-- O

Those O
kids O
who O
were O
younger O
than O
us O
who O
had O
done O
well O
in O
school O
, O
, O
compared O
to O
me O
, O
they O
had O
a O
future O
, O
um O
, O
they O
could O
stand O
out O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
I O
was O
hopeless O
, O
right O
off O
I O
was O
feeling O
down O
. O

Very O
clearly O
a O
-- O

If O
you O
wanted O
to O
take O
the O
exams O
, O
what O
kind O
of O
score O
did O
you O
think O
you O
'd O
get O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
take O
the O
exams O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
nerve O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
try O
, O
so O
-- O

, O
the O
extraordinary O
thing O
was O
, O
at O
that O
time O
my O
mom O
was O
attending O
the O
film O
institute O
, O
she O
was O
an O
instructor O
there O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
, O
I O
had O
n't O
thought O
, O
, O
that O
I O
would O
work O
in O
the O
movie O
. O

Mm O
. O

, O
um O
, O
she O
wanted O
to O
send O
the O
recruitment O
announcement O
to O
a O
friend O
's O
house O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
then O
I O
-- O

One O
day O
she O
sent O
me O
to O
deliver O
it O
, O
and O
so O
I O
picked O
it O
up O
and O
read O
it O
, O
and O
once O
I O
read O
it O
, O
oh O
! O
The O
directing O
department O
of O
the O
film O
institute O
, O
inside O
, O
no O
language O
exams O
, O
no O
math O
or O
physics O
or O
chemistry O
exams O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
wow O
! O
This O
is O
just O
the O
ticket O
. O

Let O
's O
run O
off O
to O
try O
and O
see O
. O

I O
thought O
you O
've O
loved O
movies O
ever O
since O
you O
were O
little O
, O
and O
then O
every O
day O
sitting O
in O
the O
movie O
theater O
you O
thought O
, O
I O
want O
to O
be O
a O
director O
. O

No O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
, O
no O
. O

It O
was O
just O
because O
there O
was O
no O
English B-MISC
exam O
, O
no O
exams O
in O
math O
or O
physics O
or O
chemistry O
. O

Right O
, O
it O
was O
very O
simple O
. O

Mm O
. O

One O
more O
thing O
, O
because O
in O
'78 B-MISC
, O
the B-ORG
Beijing I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
was O
recruiting O
students O
in O
Shanghai B-LOC
-- O

Right O
. O

So O
, O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
went O
to O
take O
the O
exams O
for O
the O
film O
institute O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
pass O
the O
exams O
. O

His O
mother O
, O
An B-PER
Qi I-PER
, O
had O
never O
thought O
that O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
would O
sign O
up O
to O
take O
the O
exam O
for O
her O
work O
unit O
, O
the B-ORG
Beijing I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
. O

But O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
in O
fact O
failed O
when O
he O
took O
the O
reinstated O
exam O
. O

Although O
it O
was O
the O
first B-MISC
time O
he O
had O
taken O
the O
exam O
, O
it O
left O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
even O
more O
convinced O
that O
movies O
were O
something O
he O
could O
do O
. O

The B-MISC
next I-MISC
year I-MISC
, O
21 B-MISC
- I-MISC
year I-MISC
- O
old O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
passed O
the O
entrance O
exam O
for O
the O
actors O
training O
class O
at O
the B-ORG
Xi'an I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Studio I-ORG
. O

Being O
an O
actor O
was O
not O
his O
goal O
; O
he O
hoped O
rather O
to O
get O
into O
the O
directing O
profession O
. O

At O
that O
time O
you O
especially O
admired O
directors O
, O
right O
? O

Mm O
, O
because O
after O
I O
got O
to O
the B-ORG
Xi'an I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Studio I-ORG
, O
um O
, O
I O
discovered O
I O
had O
the O
shakes O
when O
I O
got O
on O
stage O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O
Now O
, O
here O
chatting O
with O
you O
, O
I O
feel O
, O
um O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
. O

Even O
today B-MISC
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
lens O
, O
I O
'm O
a O
nervous O
wreck O
. O

Mm O
, O
very O
tense O
. O

Did O
you O
act O
then O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
every O
day O
we O
had O
to O
, O
um O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
just O
recitation O
, O
so O
, O
doing O
sketches O
, O
this O
and O
that O
. O

I O
thought O
, O
this O
is O
definitely O
not O
working O
. O

Just O
getting O
on O
stage O
gave O
you O
the O
shakes O
. O

Then O
, O
, O
no O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
my O
thing O
, O
this O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
find O
out O
why O
, O
and O
besides O
in O
those O
days O
, O

Um O
, O
it O
was O
in O
'80 B-MISC
that O
I O
went O
to O
the B-ORG
Xi'an I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Studio I-ORG
, O

Mm O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
it O
was O
, O
always O
that O
kind O
of O
pompous O
stuff O
, O
or O
, O
that O
milquetoast O
kind O
of O
young O
male O
character O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
not O
that O
kind O
of O
person O
, O
so O
I O
could O
n't O
get O
my O
bearings O
. O

So O
then O
at O
the O
same O
time O
when O
I O
saw O
that B-PER
Teng I-PER
Wenji I-PER
, O
he O
was O
probably O
thirty B-MISC
- I-MISC
some I-MISC
years I-MISC
old O
, O
he O
was O
the O
previous O
generation O
to O
us O
, O
very O
stubborn O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

That O
projecting O
force O
of O
his O
, O
I O
thought O
wow O
, O
, O
that O
's O
really O
good O
. O

He O
could O
really O
project O
. O

Because O
ultimately O
, O
there O
, O
I O
gradually O
realized O
this O
. O

Mm O
. O

And O
I O
would O
be O
in O
the O
audience O
and O
see O
him O
directing O
on O
site O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
, O
I O
could O
see O
how O
they O
worked O
. O

In O
fact O
in O
the O
beginning O
the O
attraction O
to O
movies O
was O
all O
these O
things O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
really O
a O
bunch O
of O
fluff O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
that O
's O
really O
fun O
, O
that O
's O
really O
interesting O
. O

I O
thought O
who O
was O
stubborn O
, O
then O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
that O
kind O
of O
person O
, O
but O
that O
did O
n't O
mean O
I O
knew O
anything O
about O
that O
profession O
. O



So O
no O
one O
ever O
came O
looking O
for O
you O
to O
do O
a O
play O
? O

At O
that O
time O
-- O

Mm O
, O
no O
one O
ever O
came O
looking O
-- O
. O

They O
looked O
, O
but O
it O
was O
always O
just O
for O
an O
extra O
. O

, O
you O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
any O
lines O
. O

Mm O
. O

That O
Xi'an B-MISC
Incident I-MISC
thing O
, O
I O
played O
an O
extra O
once O
. O

There O
was O
a O
guy O
playing O
Zhang B-PER
Xueliang I-PER
, O
and O
I O
played O
his O
secretary O
going O
in O
to O
report O
to O
him O
, O
and O
I O
did O
it O
a O
few O
times O
but O
I O
was O
always O
in O
the O
wrong O
place O
. O

What O
were O
your O
lines O
supposed O
to O
be O
? O

It O
was O
" O
reporting O
, O
a O
telegram O
" O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O

So O
you O
-- O

So O
I O
had O
never O
served O
as O
a O
soldier O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
pose O
, O
it O
was O
really O
awful O
. O

So O
after O
I O
gave O
that O
up O
, O
no O
, O
it O
was O
not O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O

So O
the O
old O
director O
, O
Cheng B-PER
Yin I-PER
, O
um O
, O

Mm O
. O

He O
would O
say O
, O
this O
is O
An B-PER
Qi I-PER
's I-PER
son O
, O
why O
is O
he O
like O
that O
? O

Do O
you O
remember O
how O
many O
takes O
you O
did O
? O

Oh O
, O
a O
lot O
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
something O
like O
ten B-MISC
plus I-MISC
times O
. O

It O
was O
too O
, O
I O
'd O
walk O
badly O
and O
turn O
like O
that O
. O

, O
I O
attended O
that O
class O
for O
half B-MISC
a I-MISC
year I-MISC
, O
um O
, O
um O
and O
then O
I O
got O
sick O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
got O
, O
, O
an O
inflammation O
of O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
, O
so O
my O
whole O
body O
was O
paralyzed O
. O

Your O
whole O
body O
was O
paralyzed O
? O

Right O
. O

Your O
whole O
body O
was O
paralyzed O
? O

Right O
. O
I O
was O
paralyzed O
for O
ten B-MISC
months I-MISC
. O

So O
you O
could O
n't O
move O
at O
all O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
move O
at O
all O
. O

When O
it O
started O
, O
my O
leg O
went O
numb O
, O
then O
my O
hand O
went O
numb O
, O
and O
then O
it O
started O
cross O
over O
, O
like O
that O
, O
and O
then O
slowly O
, O
slowly O
, O
slowly O
I O
could O
n't O
move O
. O

What O
's O
the O
scientific O
name O
of O
the O
disease O
? O

It O
's O
called O
Guillain O
- O
Barre O
Syndrome O
. O

It O
's O
named O
after O
a O
foreigner O
. O

Mm O
. O

Ahem O
, O
if O
naming O
it O
somewhat O
common O
, O
it O
's O
, O
a O
paralysis O
of O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
, O
um O
, O
it O
goes O
from O
the O
nerve O
endings O
to O
the O
flesh O
, O
and O
, O
then O
it O
turns O
into O
myasthenia O
. O

And O
how O
did O
you O
get O
better O
, O
later O
? O

Hormones O
. O

You O
took O
hormones O
. O

Um O
, O
, O
every O
day O
I O
had O
a O
transfusion O
. O

Mm O
, O
after O
you O
get O
hormones O
, O
people O
may O
get O
very O
fat O
. O

Mm O
. O

Very O
fat O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
fat O
now O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
then O
it O
's O
much O
better O
, O
in O
fact O
. O

At O
that O
time O
how O
fat O
were O
you O
? O

Yah O
. O

Getting O
so O
fat O
, O
it O
was O
this O
, O
if O
I O
looked O
down O
I O
could O
see O
my O
own O
cheeks O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
really O
fat O
. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
? O

If O
I O
just O
look O
down O
, O
my O
cheeks O
are O
right O
here O
. O

But O
after O
they O
finished O
with O
the O
hormones O
, O
I O
gradually O
got O
better O
. O

Mm O
. O

The O
flesh O
all O
atrophied O
, O
um O
. O

If O
you O
look O
at O
when O
I O
was O
in O
middle O
school O
, O
based O
on O
that O
bit O
of O
exercise O
-- O

Later O
, O
based O
on O
that O
, O
it O
all O
evaporated O
. O



I O
've O
heard O
it O
said O
that O
that O
Wang B-PER
Shuo I-PER
novel O
, O
which O
we O
later O
saw O
as O
a O
television O
play O
-- O

Sometimes O
, O
oh O
, O
right O
. O

Mm O
. O

Get O
some O
fun O
. O

Get O
some O
fun O
. O

The O
language O
in O
that O
, O
the O
part O
Wang B-PER
Zhiwen I-PER
played O
, O
the O
disease O
he O
got O
is O
about O
the O
same O
as O
your O
disease O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
? O

Right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
. O

So O
sometimes O
, O
oh O
, O
it O
was O
me O
and O
Wang B-PER
Shuo I-PER
, O
together O
, O
it O
was O
, O
um O
, O
in O
'89 B-MISC
. O

Mm O
, O
together O
, O
um O
, O
wrote O
a O
-- O
. O

Aye O
, O
the O
script O
I O
wanted O
, O
the O
novel O
he O
wrote O
, O
um O
, O
that O
piece O
we O
created O
together O
. O

Mm O
. O

Therefore O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
we O
were O
talking O
and O
talking O
to O
shoot O
, O
an O
urban O
love O
story O
, O
tell O
a O
love O
story O
, O
so O
he O
took O
me O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
, O
more O
or O
less O
that O
story O
, O
as O
background O
. O

Mm O

Then O
after O

and O
were O
eating O

Wang B-PER
Shuo I-PER

the O
first B-MISC

Then O
, O
when O
I O
saw O
him O
for O
the O
first B-MISC
time O
, O
Wang B-PER
Shuo I-PER
was O
holding O
a O
book O
in O
his O

a O
book O
, O
that O
was O
Floating B-MISC

Gave O
it O

me O
, O
and O
I O
took O
it O
back O
to O

to O

I O
read O
it O
and O
wow O

thought O

would O
be O
able O
-- O

Our O
generation O
could O
really O
find O
ourselves O
, O
I O
mean O
-- O

Um O
, O
in O
the O
end O
I O
knew O
we O
-- O

Why O
we O
studied O
movies O
, O
um O
, O
and O
why O
wrote O
things O
, O
expressing O
one O
's O
own O
kind O
of O

is O
the O
most O
accurate O
person O

Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER

already O
read O
Wang B-PER
Shuo I-PER

Love B-MISC
the I-MISC
Hard I-MISC
Way I-MISC
, O
and O
the O
story O
and O
the O
style O
it O
was O
written O
in O
made O
a O
profound O
impression O
on O
him O
. O

He O
sighed O
, O
this O
expresses O
what O
our O
generation O
really O
wants O
to O
express O
. O

Later O
he O
was O
introduced O
by O
a O
friend O
, O
and O
Ye B-PER
Daying I-PER
met O
the O
author O
of O
the O

Wang B-PER
Shuo I-PER

there O

some O
new O
developments O
to O
talk O
about O
tonight B-MISC

Scientists O
may O
be O
even O
closer O
to O
solving O
the O
mystery O

For O
an O
update O
we O
're O
joined O

Dr. O
Robert B-PER
Mann I-PER
one B-MISC
of O
the O
senior O
scientists O
you O
just O
saw O
working O
on O
this O
cold O
case O
/. O

Thanks O
for O
spending O
time O
with O
us O
tonight B-MISC
doctor O
/. O

We O
understand O
since O
Thelma B-PER
left O
your O
laboratories O
you O
've O
now O
wittled O
this O
down O
to O
perhaps O
four B-MISC
airmen O
/. O

is O
that O
true O
/? O

Well O
hi O
Paula B-PER
/. O

yes O
we O
have O
/. O

Uh O
when O
the O
remains O
came O
in O
a B-MISC
little I-MISC
over I-MISC
a I-MISC
week I-MISC
ago I-MISC
our O
analysts O
and O
historians O
got O
to O
work O
on O
that O
/. O

and O
they O
were O
able O
to O
wittle O
it O
down O
the O
number O
of O
missing O
aircraft O
uh O
to O
a O
few O
/. O

and O
at O
this O
point O
they O
've O
wittled O
it O
down O
to O
one B-MISC
aircraft O
and O
a O
missing O
crew O
of O
four B-MISC
individuals O
/. O

So O
we O
've O
gone O
from O
several O
possible O
aircraft O
to O
one B-MISC
aircraft O
and O
from O
several O
missing O
airmen O
to O
four B-MISC
/. O

So O
how O
much O
easier O
will O
that O
make O
it O
for O
you O
to O
unlock O
this O
case O
, O
do O
you O
think O
/? O

Well O
I O
think O
it O
'll O
help O
quite O
a O
bit O
/. O

Um O
any O
time O
you O
've O
got O
a O
body O
uh O
or O
remains O
like O
this O
that O
has O
come O
in O
and O
they O
're O
in O
pretty O
good O
condition O
such O
as O
this O
one O
is O
, O
it O
's O
mummified O
remains O
/. O

We O
have O
some O
soft O
tissue O
we O
can O
deal O
with O
/. O

so O
we O
can O
look O
at O
the O
color O
of O
the O
hair O
/. O

we O
can O
tell O
right O
away O
the O
race O
and O
the O
sex O
of O
the O
individual O
/. O

but O
then O
there O
are O
other O
things O
that O
are O
hidden O
beneath O
the O
soft O
tissue O
that O
are O
revealed O
only O
in O
the O
skeleton O
/. O

and O
that O
's O
where O
we O
're O
going O
to O
now O
/. O

So O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
full O
disclosure O
what O
I O
know O
about O
forensics O
is O
basically O
what O
I O
've O
learned O
on O
CSI B-MISC
/. O

and O
one O
would O
think O
that O
because O
you O
've O
got O
it O
now O
narrowed O
down O
to O
four B-MISC
potential O
airmen O
that O
perhaps O
you O
could O
go O
to O
four B-MISC
families O
get O
strands O
of O
hair O
and O
try O
to O
do O
a O
potential O
DNA O
match O
with O
what O
you O
've O
found O
in O
the O
ice O
/. O

Is O
it O
not O
that O
simple O
/? O

Well O
no O
no O
it O
's O
not O
that O
simple O
/. O

Um O
one O
thing O
we O
always O
caution O
people O
about O
is O
the O
pool O
of O
aircraft O
and O
missing O
airmen O
could O
be O
larger O
than O
what O
we O
're O
looking O
at O
/. O

And O
what O
we O
want O
to O
do O
is O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
just O
look O
at O
the O
material O
evidence O
that O
we O
have O
and O
immediately O
um O
jump O
to O
a O
conclusion O
that O
this O
is O
a O
certain O
individual O
/. O

What O
we O
want O
to O
do O
is O
have O
the O
evidence O
speak O
for O
itself O
/. O

and O
when O
we O
look O
at O
this O
individual O
as O
we O
've O
done O
the O
biological O
profile O
looking O
at O
his O
remains O
his O
bones O
his O
teeth O
and O
the O
material O
evidence O
/. O

and O
what O
we O
're O
able O
to O
tell O
from O
this O
individual O
is O
that O
he O
died O
in O
his B-MISC
twenties I-MISC
he O
stood O
somewhere O
between O
five B-MISC
foot I-MISC
nine I-MISC
and O
six B-MISC
foot I-MISC
two I-MISC
inches I-MISC
tall O
um O
he O
sustained O
massive O
trauma O
to O
his O
body O
on O
impact O
/. O

And O
he O
's O
Caucasoid B-MISC
male O
/. O

and O
so O
we O
know O
much O
more O
now O
just B-MISC
one I-MISC
week I-MISC
later I-MISC
than O
what O
we O
did O
when O
he O
came O
in O
about B-MISC
eight I-MISC
days I-MISC
ago I-MISC
/. O

So O
the O
most O
important O
question O
is O
when O
do O
you O
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
know O
exactly O
who O
he O
is O
/? O

Well O
that O
's O
the O
most O
commonly O
asked O
question O
that O
we O
have O
/. O

and O
you O
know O
the O
reality O
is O
nobody O
can O
give O
you O

Uh O
let O
's O
talk O

we O

I O
see O
that O
in O

the O
increase O
in O
the O

the O

reached O
eighty B-MISC

nine I-MISC
percent I-MISC

By O
2003 B-MISC
, O
eh O
, O
the O
percentage O
of O
the O
increase O
hit O
ninety B-MISC
- I-MISC
five I-MISC
percent I-MISC
. O

In O
2004 B-MISC
, O
eh O
, O
it O
reached O
197 B-MISC
percent I-MISC
. O

Then O
, O
in O
2005 B-MISC
, O
it O
hit O
50.3 B-MISC
percent I-MISC
. O

Well O
, O
how O
is O
the O
situation O
this B-MISC
year I-MISC
. O

This B-MISC
year I-MISC
applications O
are O
still O
really O
hot O
. O

Hot O
to O
what O
degree O
. O

Let O
's O
put O
it O
this O
way O
, O
ah O
, O
this B-MISC
year I-MISC
central O
government O
institutions O
, O
eh O
, O
and O
their O
subordinate O
organizations O
have O
provided O
more O
than O
twelve B-MISC
thousand I-MISC

, O
while O
the O
number O
of O
people O
applying O
broke O
through O
the O
one B-MISC
million I-MISC

. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh O
, O
over B-MISC
twelve I-MISC
thousand I-MISC
posts O
, O
with O
the O
number O
of O
applicants O
exceeding O
one B-MISC
million I-MISC
. O

That O
's O
one B-MISC
percent I-MISC
. O

Right O
. O

That O
is O
, O
it O
was O
one B-MISC
percent I-MISC
of O
the O
number O
of O
people O
. O

Yes O
, O
yes O
. O

But O
we O
still O
have O
to O
explain O
a O
bit O
what O
's O
going O
on O
inside O
, O
eh O
, O
these O
figures O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Actually O
, O
the O
number O
of O
people O
who O
actually O
take O
the O
confirmation O
exam O
is O
now O
more O
than O
530,000 B-MISC

And O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
recruitment O
ratio O
is O
also O
one O
in O
more O
than O
forty O
. O

Uh O
, O
approximately O
one B-MISC
in O
about O
forty B-MISC
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
that O
there O
are O
about O
forty B-MISC
people O
competing O
for O
eh O
, O
one B-MISC
position O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Judging O
from O
the O
level O
of O
competition O
, O
these B-MISC
few I-MISC
years I-MISC
, O
eh O
, O
have O
also O
shown O
a O
steadily O
increasing O
trend O
. O

I O
've O
heard O
, O
um O
, O
for O
certain O
particularly O
hot O
positions O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
to O
reach O
a O
thousand B-MISC
to O
one B-MISC
. O




I O
heard O
your O
friends O
say O
this O
, O
eh O
, O
saying O
that O
there O
is O
half O
of O
Ding B-LOC
Naizhu I-LOC
in O
Lai B-LOC
Shengchuan I-LOC
, O
and O
half O
of O
Lai B-LOC
Shengchuan I-LOC
in O
Ding B-LOC
Naizhu I-LOC
. O

What O
does O
this O
mean O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ah O
, O
can O
agree O
. O

Can O
you O
. O

Yes O
. O

The O
reason O
is O
because O
we O
two B-MISC
actually O
have O
very O
, O
very O
, O
different O
personalities O
. O

Eh O
. O

Because O
in O
actual O
fact O
we O
well O
complement O
each O
other O
. O

Oh O
. O

Er O
, O
ordinary O
people O
would O
think O
, O
um O
, O
that O
he O
is O
probably O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
is O
, O
more O
heedless O
, O
or O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
maybe O
I O
appear O
more O
careful O
. O

Yes O
. O

Actually O
, O
we O
two B-MISC
are O
the O
exact O
opposite O
, O
he O
is O
very O
careful O
, O
very O
careful O
. O

Oh O
. O

Yes O
. O

And O
I O
am O
careless O
, O
when O
I O
put O
something O
away O
, O
it O
will O
be O
lost O
or O
it O
will O
be O
missing O
. O

Like O
me O
, O
this O
, O
many O
, O
this O
-- O

However O
, O
we O
two B-MISC
, O
that O
is O
, O
complement O
each O
other O
very O
, O
very O
well O
. O

Like O
in O
the O
troupe O
, O
ah O
, O
er O
, O
I O
actually O
decide O
the O
general O
direction O
of O
the O
whole O
troupe O
. O

Yes O
. O

for O
instance O
, O
I O
will O
decide O
on O
the O
way O
the O
troupe O
will O
proceed O
. O

I O
am O
the O
one O
who O
focuses O
on O
this O
big O
direction O
. O

Oh O
. O

Usually O
, O
it O
does O
not O
matter O
to O
him O
. O

He O
is O
on O
the O
production O
side O
, O
like O
this O
, O
oh O
. O

Eh O
, O
but O
whenever O
it O
pertains O
to O
the O
details O
, O
eh O
, O
he O
is O
detailed O
, O
and O
he O
is O
very O
clear O
. O

Yes O
. O

I O
heard O
that O
Mr. O
Lai B-PER
will O
even O
slice O
cabbage O
very O
finely O
and O
delicately O
. O

Yes O
. O

Very O
much O
so O
, O

everything O
he O
does O
, O
he O
wants O
the O
ambience O
to O
be O
just O
so O
, O
he O
is O
particular O
about O
the O
atmosphere O
, O
very O
particular O
. O

He O
cooks O
, O
we O
both O
like O
to O
cook O
. O

Yes O
. O

When O
I O
cook O
, O
I O
cook O
, O
I O
can O
cook O
under O
any O
circumstance O
. O

Yes O
. O

When O
he O
cooks O
, O
he O
needs O
to O
put O
on O
the O
music O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
light O
, O
the O
music O
. O

Like O
this O
-- O

Oh O
yes O
, O
so O
when O
he O
cooks O
, O
it O
's O
very O
troublesome O
. O

Yes O
. O




We O
mentioned O
in O
the O
news O
earlier O
, O
ah O
, O
on O
that O
there O
were O
over B-MISC
a I-MISC
hundred I-MISC
flights O
, O
and O
tens B-MISC
of I-MISC
thousands I-MISC
of O
people O
might O
be O
affected O
. O

So O
do O
we O
know O
right O
now O
if O
there O
is O
any O
new O
progress O
in O
the O
investigation O
. O

Er O
, O
or O
I O
should O
say O
that O
the O
investigation O
is O
, O
eh O
, O
I O
should O
say O
, O
being O
aggressively O
carried O
out O
right O
now O
, O
ah O
. O

Right O
now O
a O
total O
of O
221 B-MISC
flights O
are O
affected O
, O
involving O
about O
, O
eh O
, O
33,000 B-MISC
passengers O
. O

Currently O
, O
these O
passengers O
, O
eh O
, O
have O
now O
, O
this O
, O
mainly O
flown O
by O
these O
three B-MISC
flights O
at O
, O
this O
, O
the O
end O
of O
this O
month O
, O

They O
were O
quite O
dispersed O
, O
some O
to O
Madrid B-LOC
, O
some O
to O
, O
eh O
, O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
some O
to O
Athens B-LOC
, O
some O
to O
Stockholm B-LOC
, O
and O
there O
were O
also O
some O
to O
Turkey B-LOC
, O
what O
to O
Austria B-LOC
. O

Therefore O
, O
right O
now O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
British B-MISC
authorities O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
are O
appealing O
to O
these O
passengers O
, O
eh O
, O
er O
, O
to O
report O
their O
, O
eh O
, O
situations O
to O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
British B-MISC
health O
department O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
eh O
, O
er O
, O
they O
have O
especially O
set O
up O
a O
hotline O
, O
um O
, O
hoping O
that O
everyone O
would O
call O
in O
. O

Well O
, O
till O
now O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
latest O
count O
is O
about O
450 B-MISC
people O
, O
eh O
, O
er O
, O
eh O
, O
who O
then O
have O
, O
eh O
, O
reported O
their O
health O
condition O
, O
eh O
, O
to O
the O
related O
British B-MISC
department O
. O

Of O
these O
, O
the O
British B-MISC
, O
eh O
, O
er O
, O
Health B-ORG
Department I-ORG
, O
eh O
, O
has O
followed O
up O
on O
18 B-MISC
people O
. O

Er O
, O
among O
them O
, O
there O
were O
three B-MISC
major O
ones O
, O
eh O
, O
er O
, O
and O
they O
were O
transferred O
to O
this O
special O
hospital O
, O
eh O
, O
for O
treatment O
. O




Of O
course O
, O
what O
all O
investors O
are O
most O
concerned O
about O
is O
, O
how O
long O
will O
this O
wave O
, O
this O
trend O
of O
appreciation O
last O
. O

Also O
, O
eh O
, O
to O
enter O
at O
a O
time O
like O
this O
, O
for O
example O
, O
in O
Hong B-LOC
Kong I-LOC
, O
he O
can O
directly O
invest O
in O
the O
Renminbi O
, O
would O
it O
be O
profitable O
to O
enter O
the O
market O
right O
now O
. O

Uh O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the O
appreciation O
of O
the O
RMB O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
will O
, O
er O
, O
be O
on O
a O
rising O
trend O
for O
a O
quite O
long O
time O
to O
come O
, O
because O
this O
is O
related O
to O
the O
, O
this O
, O
conditions O
of O
savings O
in O
China B-LOC
itself O
. O

And O
behind O
the O
change O
in O
savings O
is O
a O
factor O
of O
demographics O
. O

Right O
now O
in O
China B-LOC
's O
, O
this O
, O
eh O
, O
a O
relatively O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
population O
are O
young O
adults O
, O
and O
these O
people O
have O
higher O
savings O
, O
as O
they O
have O
to O
save O
for O
their O
children O
's O
education O
, O
and O
for O
their O
own O
retirement O
. O

Yes O
. O

Therefore O
, O
during O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
middle O
of O
this O
stage O
, O
er O
, O
the O
high O
savings O
has O
resulted O
in O
a O
larger O
surplus O
in O
China B-LOC
's O
regular O
accounts O
. O

So O
this O
trend O
will O
last O
for O
a O
period O
of O
time O
. O

But O
the O
issue O
is O
that O
the O
appreciation O
right O
now O
should O
be O
viewed O
as O
a O
gradual O
appreciation O
on O
a O
small O
scale O
. O

So O
right O
now O
if O
you O
ask O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
will O
be O
profitable O
, O
eh O
, O
to O
exchange O
, O
this O
, O
other O
currencies O
into O
Renminbi O
, O
we O
will O
need O
to O
look O
at O
, O
this O
, O
this O
, O
the O
deficit O
. O




So O
, O
as O
long O
as O
it O
is O
an O
independent O
brand O
name O
, O
ah O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
expansion O
of O
your O
own O
company O
, O
you O
would O
naturally O
assume O
a O
type O
of O
responsibility O
. O

Therefore O
in O
this O
process O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
is O
not O
only O
an O
operation O
with O
your O
own O
brand O
, O
and O
not O
only O
a O
domestic O
market O
- O
oriented O
approach O
with O
your O
own O
say O
, O
you O
can O
even O
create O
more O
opportunities O
for O
such O
cooperation O
in O
the O
global O
market O
, O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
operation O
that O
is O
geared O
toward O
our O
interests O
. O

Therefore O
in O
this O
case O
, O
from O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
country O
, O
and O
from O
the O
, O
er O
, O
benefits O
on O
the O
part O
of O
both O
clients O
and O
partners O
, O
all O
these O
areas O
manifest O
the O
existence O
value O
of O
the O
enterprise O
Chery B-ORG
. O

I O
know O
, O
people O
working O
in O
Chery B-ORG
have O
a O
saying O
: O
We O
will O
fight O
20 B-MISC
years I-MISC
to O
have O
our O
own O
brand O
name O
. O

eh O
, O
from O
the O
time O
Chery B-ORG
was O
founded O
to O
now O
, O
half O
of O
that O
time O
has O
already O
gone O
by O
. O

In O
the O
remaining O
half O
, O
which O
is O
the O
next O
ten O
years O
, O
will O
we O
see O
a O
more O
brilliant O
Chery B-ORG
for O
sure O
. O

Yes O
. O

This O
Comrade O
Zhang B-PER
Hailai I-PER
has O
continued O
to O
teach O
us O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
people O
in O
the O
car O
industry O
should O
not O
be O
crazy O
, O
otherwise O
they O
will O
be O
killed O
. O

So O
, O
we O
have O
already O
been O
crazy O
for O
the O
past O
ten B-MISC
years I-MISC
. O

I O
think O
the O
next O
ten B-MISC
years I-MISC
is O
a O
decade O
that O
Chery B-ORG
needs O
to O
be O
even O
crazier O
. O

Of O
course O
together O
let O
us O
wish O
that O
Chery B-ORG
, O
and O
wish O
that O
China B-LOC
would O
stand O
out O
from O
the O
crowd O
among O
the O
future O
competition O
within O
the O
car O
industry O
and O
break O
through O
all O
kinds O
of O
difficulties O
, O
and O
really O
bring O
honor O
to O
the O
people O
of O
China B-LOC
. O




A O
mentally O
ill O
person O
can O
do O
some O
terrible O
things O
, O
right O
. O

He O
may O
kill O
other O
people O
, O
and O
not O
have O
to O
bear O
any O
legal O
responsibilities O
. O

So O
what O
should O
be O
done O
. O

Hence O
the O
entire O
police O
, O
the O
entire O
social O
system O
should O
begin O
to O
monitor O
the O
mental O
state O
of O
the O
people O
. O

Oh O
, O
this O
point O
of O
yours O
reminds O
me O
of O
that O
situation O
of O
Foucault B-PER
. O

Yes O
, O
that O
's O
right O
, O
which O
is O
to O
start O
monitoring O
mental O
conditions O
. O

How O
to O
go O
about O
monitoring O
. O

For O
instance O
mental O
health O
is O
greatly O
emphasized O
in O
schools O
. O

Er O
, O
there O
are O
many O
hospitals O
and O
social O
workers O
in O
the O
community O
, O
right O
. O

Social O
workers O
they O
have O
to O
extensively O
visit O
different O
family O
communities O
, O
to O
see O
whether O
the O
members O
of O
this O
family O
, O
ah O
, O
are O
arguing O
all O
the O
time O
, O
or O
whether O
there O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
marital O
discord O
between O
wife O
and O
husband O
. O

They O
, O
eh O
, O
greatly O
advocated O
the O
popularization O
of O
psychiatrists O
. O

So O
do O
you O
remember O
, O
when O
you O
, O
Mr. O
Xu B-PER
, O
first O
went O
to O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
you O
felt O
that O
the O
Americans B-MISC
were O
so O
abnormal O
for O
seeing O
psychiatrists O
even O
for O
minor O
issues O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

In O
this O
kind O
of O
society O
like O
theirs O
, O
it O
's O
not O
all O
that O
unusual O
to O
see O
a O
psychiatrist O
. O

They O
have O
normalized O
that O
. O

This O
is O
how O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
entire O
community O
keeps O
monitoring O
everyone O
's O
mental O
state O
. O




Hi O
everyone O
/. O

first B-MISC
up O
on O
the O
docket O
tonight B-MISC
we O
got O
an O
interview O
with O
the O
witness O
who O
led O
investigators O
to O
a O
landfill O
in O
the O
search O
for O
Natalee B-PER
Holloway I-PER
/. O

He O
's O
telling O
NBC B-ORG
news O
what O
and O
who O
he O
saw O
just B-MISC
days I-MISC
after O
Natalee B-PER
's O
May B-MISC
thirtieth I-MISC
disappearance O
/. O

Also O
Natalee B-PER
's O
mother O
met O
with O
the O
lead O
prosecutor O
in O
the O
investigation O
today B-MISC
/. O

And O
while O
the O
landfill O
continues O
to O
be O
searched O
and O
lead O
suspect O
Joran B-PER
Van I-PER
Der I-PER
Sloot I-PER
is O
interrogated O
for O
the B-MISC
fourth I-MISC
straight I-MISC
day I-MISC
by O
a O
team O
of O
behavioral O
specialists O
NBC B-ORG
's O
Michelle B-PER
Kosinski I-PER
remains O
in O
Aruba B-LOC
/. O

So O
Michelle B-PER
the O
authorities O
really O
believe O
that O
uh O
this O
witness O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
landfill O
's O
credible O
, O
do O
n't O
they O
/? O

Well O
the O
authorities O
including O
the O
FBI B-ORG
we O
found O
out O
had O
checked O
this O
witness O
out O
early O
on O
just B-MISC
days I-MISC
after O
Natalee B-PER
disappeared O
/. O

And O
we O
just O
found O
out O
about O
this O
witness O
a B-MISC
couple I-MISC
weeks I-MISC
ago I-MISC
/. O

That O
's O
when O
his O
existence O
became O
widely O
known O
through O
private O
investigators O
and O
other O
sources O
/. O

And O
it O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
he O
was O
afraid O
to O
come O
forward O
/. O

Well O
it O
turns O
out O
he O
was O
just O
afraid O
for O
his O
identity O
to O
be O
known O
/. O

but O
we O
learned O
that O
he O
came O
forward O
very O
quickly O
after O
he O
says O
he O
saw O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
landfill O
that B-MISC
day I-MISC
just B-MISC
days I-MISC
after O
it O
happened O
/. O

He O
talked O
to O
police O
/. O

He O
talked O
to O
the O
FBI B-ORG
/. O

The O
FBI B-ORG
actually O
went O
out O
to O
that O
landfill O
with O
dogs O
looked O
around O
that O
area O
even O
before O
it O
became O
piled O
up O
with O
garbage O
/. O

and O
they O
did O
n't O
find O
anything O
/. O

It O
's O
the O
EquuSearch B-ORG
volunteers O
who O
really O
said O
hey O
we O
believe O
this O
guy O
/. O

His O
story O
does O
n't O
change O
/. O

He O
seems O
to O
pan O
out O
/. O

He O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
lucid O
guy O
/. O

He O
seems O
to O
also O
be O
insistent O
that O
he O
saw O
something O
/. O

So O
he O
says O
he O
saw O
some O
men O
drive O
up O
in O
a O
white O
pickup O
truck O
men O
that O
he O
says O
he O
later O
recognized O
to O
be O
the O
three B-MISC
suspects O
in O
this O
case O
/. O

He O
says O
they O
took O
what O
looked O
like O
a O
body O
out O
of O
the O
back O
of O
the O
pickup O
truck O
/. O

It O
was O
wrapped O
up O
in O
a O
bag O
/. O

But O
when O
the O
wind O
blew O
he O
says O
he O
saw O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
a O
woman O
's O
body O
blonde O
hair O
/. O

and O
then O
he O
says O
they O
buried O
this O
body O
there O
in O
the O
landfill O
/. O

Well O
over O
a B-MISC
period I-MISC
of I-MISC
weeks I-MISC
some B-MISC
ten I-MISC
feet I-MISC
of O
garbage O
has O
piled O
up O
/. O

EquuSearch B-ORG
will O
tell O
you O
too O
that O
when O
they O
bring O
out O
dogs O
it O
's O
very O
difficult O
for O
a O
dog O
to O
catch O
a O
scent O
in O
that O
landfill O
when O
they O
're O
coming O
across O
things O
like O
medical O
waste O
/. O

but O
they O
're O
determined O
to O
keep O
going O
/. O

He O
saw O
uh O
the O
woman O
's O
body O
and O
inside O
a O
bag O
/. O

Her O
hair O
was O
blowing O
out O
with O
the O
wind O
/. O

And O
uh O
he O
did O
n't O
say O
this O
now O
/. O

but O
he O
told O
that O
the O
back O
kind O
of O
came O
off O
and O
he O
saw O
half O
of O
the O
woman O
's O
body O
/. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
compelling O
reasons O
searchers O
say O
they O
believe O
this O
guy O
very O
much O
is O
that O
they O
say O
he O
gave O
them O
some O
clues O
as O
to O
things O
they O
would O
find O
buried O
deep O
within O
that O
garbage O
around O
that O
same O
area O
where O
he O
claims O
he O
saw O
a O
body O
things O
like O
a O
plastic O
pool O
/. O

He O
said O
that O
there O
was O
a O
dirt O
road O
buried O
under O
all O
that O
garbage O
/. O

Well O
they O
found O
those O
things O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
other O
items O
that O
he O
said O
would O
be O
there O
/. O

The O
problem O
is O
they O
just O
have O
n't O
found O
any O
sign O
at O
all O
of O
Natalee B-PER
Holloway I-PER
/. O

but O
they O
want O
to O
clear O
that O
place O
out O
and O
just O
feel O
satisfied O
that O
they O
looked O
as O
best O
they O
could O
because O
it O
's O
disturbing O
/. O

I O
mean O
his O
story O
has O
panned O
out O
in O
some O
ways O
/. O

so O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
give O
this O
up O
/. O

Well O
that O
's O
the O
question O
I O
have O
for O
you O
Michelle B-PER
/. O

So O
are O
you O
saying O
that O
the O
authorities O
uh O
looked O
into O
this O
guy O
's O
story O
early O
on O
and O
they O
kind O
of O
pooh O
- O
poohed O
it O
and O
then O
EquuSearch B-ORG
came O
in O
a B-MISC
couple I-MISC
weeks I-MISC
later I-MISC
and O
said O
wait O
a O
sec O
, O
wait O
a O
sec O
, O
let O
's O
give O
this O
guy O
a O
shot O
here O
and O
they O
followed O
up O
on O
it O
/? O

Yeah O
pretty O
much O
/. O

Uh O
the O
witness O
told O
us O
directly O
that O
in O
the O
beginning O
he O
felt O
like O
nobody O
was O
believing O
his O
story O
/. O

But O
we O
talked O
to O
a O
high O
level O
source O
in O
law O
enforcement O
/. O

and O
it O
turns O
out O
they O
did O
check O
it O
out O
/. O

Hm O
/. O

They O
sent O
the O
FBI B-ORG
out O
there O
with O
a O
dog O
/. O

But O
EquuSearch B-ORG
says O
hey O
maybe O
we O
can O
do O
something O
more O
thoroughly O
here O
/. O

We O
can O
bring O
out O
teams O
of O
dogs O
/. O

But O
here O
's O
the O
thing O
/. O

They O
still O
have O
n't O
found O
one B-MISC
sign O
of O
her O
/. O

but O
uh O
they O
are O
determined O
to O
keep O
it O
up O
through O
the B-MISC
weekend I-MISC
at O
least O
/. O

Alright O
Michelle B-PER
Kosinski I-PER
as O
always O
thanks O
a O
lot O
/. O



And O
as O
Michelle B-PER
reported O
Natalee B-PER
's O
mother O
Beth B-PER
Holloway I-PER
Twitty I-PER
met O
with O
the O
lead O
prosecutor O
in O
the O
investigation O
this B-MISC
afternoon I-MISC
Karin B-PER
Janssen I-PER
where O
she O
told O
Janssen B-PER
about O
a O
girl O
came O
forward O
said O
she O
had O
an O
encounter O
with O
Joran B-PER
Van I-PER
Der I-PER
Sloot I-PER
the O
chief O
suspect O
/. O

And O
on O
our O
program O
last B-MISC
night I-MISC
Beth B-PER
told O
me O
the O
story O

A O
beautiful O
eighteen B-MISC
year I-MISC
old I-MISC
blonde O

headed O
girl O
from O
New B-LOC

you O

was O
able O
to O
recount O
an O

she O

with O
Joran B-PER

during O
the B-MISC
month I-MISC
of I-MISC
April I-MISC
oh I-MISC
five I-MISC
/. O

And O
what O
did O
she O
say O
happened O
/? O

you O
know O
it O
's O
a O
pretty O
long O
scenario O

We O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
details O
/. O

Um O
you O
know O
the O
main O
thing O
to O
to O
sum O
it O
up O
as O
you O
know O
Joran B-PER
how O
he O
entered O
this O
establishment O
/. O

I O
believe O
that O
you O
know O
if O
you O
enter O

the O
right O

you O
have O
to O
have O
a O
valid O

You O
enter O
Carlos B-ORG

left O
side O
+approaches O
these O
group O
of O

Um O
you O
know O
it O
's O
interesting O
how O
he O
is O
able O
to O
um O
try O
to O
work O
his O
way O
in O
and O
connect O
establish O
himself O
in O
uh O
Carlos B-ORG

Was O
walking O
her O
around O

these O
other O

was O
able O
to O
point O
out O
Satish B-PER

Deepak B-PER

They O
're O
sitting O
ironically O
in O
the O

corner O
the O

that O
they O
were O
seated O
at O
in O
the O
picture O
that O

been O
all O
over O
international O

So O
that O
must O
be O
their O
spot O
where O
they O
wait O
while O
Joran B-PER
is O
working O
/. O

And O
um O
you O
know O
it O
was O
so O
interesting O
how O
everyone O
in O
the O
casino O
knew O
Joran B-PER

you O
know O
he O
knew O
everyone O
was O
greeting O
all O
the O

with O
this O
grip O
handshake O

All O
the O
girls O
approach O
him O
with O
a O
kiss O
on O
the O

It O
was O
interesting O
how O
um O
you O
know O
he O
was O
able O
to O
order O
these O
group O
of O

by O
just O
merely O
leaning O
over O

three B-MISC

one I-MISC
one B-MISC

three B-MISC

the O

he O

got O
an O
open O
uh O
tab O
at O

And O
you O
know O
then O
you O
notice O
that O
in O
a O
evening B-MISC

proceeding O
he O

even O
approaching O
these O

close O

that O

another O

did O
she O

anything O
about O
uh O

No O
she O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
about O

but O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
was O
a O
history O
is O
a O
predatory O
type O
behavior O
which O
I O
think O
Joran B-PER

Deepak B-PER

how O
tightly O

three B-MISC

them O
from O
the O
bar O
and O
whatever O
he O
's O
doing O
with O
them O
after O
that O
/. O

But O
if O
there O
's O
no O
violence O
associated O
with O
that O
does O
that O
help O
you O
in O
the O
investigation O
/? O

Well O
again O
we O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
was O
a O
violent O
issue O
with O
him O
with O
Natalee B-PER
/. O

We O
think O
probably O
+something O
has O
happened O
to O
Natalee B-PER
/. O

and O
they O
panicked O
and O
then O
went O
forth O
and O
did O
what O
they O
were O
supposed O
to O
do O
/. O

I O
mean O
there O
's O
issues O
that O
's O
come O
up O
/. O

Um O
um O
well O
we O
feel O
something O
happened O
when O
Natalee B-PER
was O
with O
them O
/. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
that O
/? O

Either O
she O
either O
passed O
out O
regurgitated O
/. O

um O
something O
had O
happened O
/. O

And O
on O
top O
of O
that O
now O
there O
's O
a O
statement O
that O
's O
come O
up O
from O
Joran B-PER
Van I-PER
Der I-PER
Sloot I-PER
that O
he O
's O
given O
to O
the O
police O
uh O
one B-MISC
of O
twenty B-MISC
- I-MISC
two I-MISC
statements O
he O
's O
given O
by O
the O
way O
that O
um O
Deepak B-PER
had O
uh O
raped O
her O
and O
killed O
her O
on O
the O
beach O
/. O

So O
at O
this O
point O
what O
the O
police O
have O
you O
know O
again O
we O
're O
unaware O
because O
we O
're O
not O
getting O
any O
information O
from O
law O
enforcement O
/. O

so O
we O
have O
to O
go O
on O
the O
course O
of O
information O
that O
we O
're O
gathering O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
family O
/. O



Well O
let O
me O
ask O
Harold B-PER
how O
do O
you O
all O
know O
that O
/? O

I O
mean O
that O
information O
for O
example O
about O
that O
particular O
statement O
that O
TJ B-PER
was O
just O
mentioning O

How O
do O
we O
know O

you O
know O
that O
that O
statement O
was O

made O

Joran B-PER

Sloot I-PER
/? O

Oh O
we O
do O
n't O
/. O

This O
is O
the O

that O
were O
being O
attributed O
to O
us O
on O
those O
/. O

Uh O
since O
we O
have O
n't O
interviewed O
Joran B-PER
we O
do O
n't O
know O
exactly O
what O
he O
has O
said O

some O
of O

uh O
through O
a O

uh O
they O

what O
the O

if O

Joining O
me O
now O
former O
Connecticut B-LOC

NBC B-ORG
News I-ORG
uh O
legal O
analyst O
Susan B-PER
Filan I-PER
who O
's O
been O
covering O
the O
case O
closely O
and O
Orlando B-LOC

chief O
Walter B-PER
uh I-PER
Zalisko I-PER

was O

well O

Alright O
so O
Susan B-PER
what O
do O
you O
know O
about O
the O
investigation O
/? O

Well O
NBC B-ORG
news I-ORG
has O
learned O
from O
a O
law O
enforcement O
source O
that O
the O
wife O
is O
not O
a O
suspect O
and O
that O
they O
are O
focusing O
in O
on O
these O
two B-MISC
Russian B-MISC
brothers O
as O
you O
said O
who O
live O
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
/. O

The O
California B-LOC
teen O
is O
apparently O
the O
key O
to O
the O
case O
at O
this O
point O
/. O

That O
's O
law O
enforcement O
's O
focus O
/. O

If O
this O
young O
man O
will O
talk O
this O
could O
break O
open O
what O
happened O
to O
George B-PER
/. O

The O
key O
question O
is O
is O
this O
a O
tragic O
accident O
or O
is O
this O
foul O
play O
/? O

Right O
now O
law O
enforcement O
seems O
to O
think O
it O
's O
foul O
play O
/. O

US B-LOC
attorney O
Kevin B-PER
O'Connor I-PER
said O
we O
have O
reason O
to O
believe O
there O
could O
have O
been O
foul O
play O
here O
/. O

Um O
alright O
uh O
Mister O
Zalisko B-PER
do O
you O
know O
anything O
from O
your O
personal O
experience O
of O
having O
been O
on O
the O
cruise O
as O
to O
what O
happened O
/? O

Uh O
good O
evening O
sir O
/. O

Uh O
first B-MISC
I O
'd O
just O
like O
to O
clarify O
I O
'm O
a O
police O
chief O
in O
Oak B-LOC
Hill I-LOC
Florida B-LOC
not O
Orlando B-LOC
/. O

Uh O
now O
as O
far O
as O
the O
cruise O
uh O
I O
was O
on O
the O
cruise O
that B-MISC
uh I-MISC
uh I-MISC
day I-MISC
/. O

and O
the O
way O
I O
became O
aware O
of O
what O
occured O
was O
that O
uh O
the B-MISC
morning I-MISC
of O
the B-MISC
fifth I-MISC
a O
relative O
of O
mine O
had O
mentioned O
that O
there O
was O
blood O
stain O
on O
the O
canopy O
beneath O
her O
uh O
balcony O
/. O

at O
that O
point O
we O
kind O
of O
dismissed O
it O
/. O

We O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
was O
uh O
going O
on O
/. O

Uh O
we O
then O
went O
on O
our O
daily O
excursion O
/. O

However O
later O
on O
into O
the O
cruise O
that B-MISC
day I-MISC
uh O
the O
ship O
's O
captain O
went O
onto O
the O
PA O
system O
and O
made O
an O
announcement O
that O
uh O
authorities O
were O
on O
the O
ship O
and O
they O
were O
investigating O
the O
possibility O
that O
an O
individual O
had O
gone O
overboard O
during O
the O
night B-MISC
or O
early B-MISC
morning I-MISC
hours I-MISC
/. O

When O
I O
asked O
my O
cousin O
the O
uh O
size O
of O
the O
blood O
splatter O
she O
had O
indicated O
it O
was O
relatively O
the O
size O
of O
a O
small O
uh O
dog O
of O
a O
beagle O
type O
/. O

However O
viewing O
those O
photographs O
on O
TV O
that O
blood O
splatter O
is O
much O
larger O
than O
uh O
a O
small O
dog O
/. O

Mhm O
/. O

In O
fact O
it O
's O
maybe B-MISC
three I-MISC
to I-MISC
four I-MISC
feet I-MISC
in O
length O
/. O

And O
then O
we O
've O
been O
hearing O
many O
stories O
that O
uh O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
going O
into O
and O
out O
of O
the O
state O
rooms O
uh O
which O
would O
indicate O
that O
the O
crime O
scene O
was O
not O
properly O
secured O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
the O
investigation O
/. O

Well O
/. O



Alright O
let O
me O
play O
this O
piece O
of O
sound O
from O
one B-MISC
of O
the O
passengers O
who O
was O
uh O
staying O
right O
nearby O
uh O
this O
particular O
uh O
room O
/. O

We O
were O
awakened O
uh O
about B-MISC
four I-MISC
in I-MISC
the I-MISC
morning I-MISC
uh O
by O
loud O
yelling O
coming O
from O
the O
cabin O
/. O

Um O
it O
sounded O
like O
people O
uh O
cheering O
uh O
like O
a O
drinking O
contest O
type O
thing O
/. O

And O
he O
says O
uh O
later O
um O
chief O
that O
he O
heard O
a O
horrific O
thud O
/. O

Well O
yeah O
that O
would O
indicate O
that O
something O
did O
go O
on O
there O
/. O

and O
we O
know O
uh O
that O
the O
three B-MISC
individuals O
were O
in O
a O
room O
uh O
with O
Mister O
Smith B-PER
/. O

And O
the O
question O
that O
has O
to O
be O
uh O
presented O
to O
everybody O
is O
why O
is O
it O
taking O
so O
long O
for O
authorities O
to O
interview O
the O
individual O
that O
was O
in O
a O
cabin O
next O
door O
/? O

Mhm O
/. O

Any O
seasoned O
investigator O
would O
know O
that O
you O
would O
want O
to O
conduct O
your O
interviews O
uh O
of O
possible O
witnesses O
immediately O
after O
the O
crime O
/. O

Yeah O
/. O

Yeah O
/. O

And O
you O
would O
not O
just O
interview O
that O
individual O
next O
door O
/. O

You O
would O
have O
to O
take O
a O
step O
to O
interview O
people O
above O
below O
and O
to O
both O
sides O
/. O

Susan B-PER
what O
's O
the O
answer O
to O
that O
/? O

But O
Dan B-PER
/. O

there O
are O
jurisdictional O
problems O
here O
/. O

You O
know O
it O
's O
not O
a O
clear O
cut O
case O
as O
to O
who O
gets O
to O
prosecute O
this O
case O
/. O

Turkey B-LOC
ca O
n't O
do O
anything O
without O
a O
body O
/. O

United B-LOC
States I-LOC
can O
/. O

Fair O
play O
of O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
for O
stepping O
in O
/. O

fair O
play O
to O
law O
enforcement O
for O
getting O
involved O
/. O

Jurisdiction O
is O
n't O
clear O
/. O

but O
they O
're O
working O
very O
hard O
to O
solve O
the O
crime O
/. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
criticism O
is O
well O
placed O
against O
law O
enforcement O
in O
this O
case O
/. O

Also O
the O
crime O
scene O
oh O
if O
you O
want O
to O
call O
it O
that O
was O
cleaned O
up O
by O
the O
cruise O
ship O
who O
got O
their O
investigators O
and O
their O
lawyers O
in O
from O
what O
I O
understand O
right O
away O
to O
make O
this O
go O
away O
/. O

so O
I O
think O
law O
enforcement O
was O
put O
in O
a O
bad O
position O
trying O
to O
play O
catchup O
/. O

and O
I O
think O
they O
're O
doing O
+an O
amazing O
job O
/. O

Larry B-PER
so O
uh O
any O
chance O
now O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
things O
have O
been O
cleaned O
up O
et O
cetera O
to O
get O
any O
usable O
evidence O
/? O

Well O
it O
's O
very O
difficult O
Dan B-PER
/. O

Uh O
obviously O
as O
we O
keep O
saying O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
body O
/. O

therefore O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
cause O
or O
a O
manner O
of O
the O
death O
/. O

But O
we O
do O
have O
some O
physical O
evidence O
/. O

Unfortunately O
examination O
of O
the O
photograph O
uh O
tells O
me O
it O
was O
not O
done O
the O
proper O
way O
/. O

It O
was O
n't O
a O
forensic O
photograph O
/. O

So O
I O
really O
do O
not O
know O
how O
large O
the O
stain O
was O
in O
its O
dimensions O
/. O

but O
it O
is O
pretty O
clear O
that O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
blood O
there O
great O
deal O
of O
blood O
/. O

It O
makes O
you O
think O
that O
something O
criminal O
occured O
/. O

But O
again O
getting O
back O
to O
how O
you O
solve O
the O
crime O
you O
got O
to O
go O
to O
the O
crime O
scene O
/. O

and O
I O
think O
there O
are O
multiple O
scenes O
here O
/. O

Every O
place O
there O
's O
blood O
it O
's O
a O
crime O
scene O
/. O

But O
the O
most O
important O
place O
is O
the O
cabin O
because O
that O
's O
presumably O
where O
the O
injury O
took O
place O
/. O

Now O
there O
was O
some O
rumor O
about O
some O
arguments O
going O
casino O
the B-MISC
night I-MISC
before I-MISC
/. O

Uh O
and O
it O
could O
very O
well O
be O
that O
he O
was O
arguing O
with O
these O
individuals O
/. O

so O
uh O
that O
could O
be O
the O
tie O
the O
connection O
/. O

and O
I O
think O
good O
policework O
would O
connect O
the O
individuals O
in O
question O
with O
the O
casino O
with O
Mister O
Smith B-PER
/. O

and O
that O
might O
help O
us O
understand O
what O
happened O
/. O

this O
is O
um O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
sound O
/. O

This O
is O
again O
from O
Cletus B-PER
Hyman I-PER
uh O
who O
was O
literally O
um O
in O
a O
joining O
or O
nearby O
cabin O
um O
as O
to O
what O
he O
heard O
around O
he O
said O
four B-MISC
in I-MISC
the I-MISC
morning I-MISC
the B-MISC
day I-MISC
before O
uh O
Mister O
Smith B-PER
went O
missing O
/. O

At O
times O
it O
sounded O
like O
furniture O
was O
being O
actually O
picked O
up O
and O
dropped O
/. O

and O
then O
that O
horrific O
uh O
thud O
/. O

Yeah O
I O
mean O
that O
sure O
sounds O
to O
me O
chief O
like O
we O
're O
not O
talking O
about O
someone O
who O
/- O

I O
mean O
I O
guess O
it O
's O
possible O
if O
you O
're O
talking O
about O
loud O
yelling O
coming O
/- O

Well O
look O
if O
this O
guy O
's O
right O
that O
loud O
yelling O
is O
coming O
from O
the O
cabin O
right O
and O
the O
wife O
is O
not O
a O
real O
suspect O
here O
means O
that O
there O
was O
probably O
someone O
else O
in O
there O
/. O

Well O
there O
absolutely O
was O
someone O
else O
in O
that O
room O
/. O

And O
what O
's O
interesting O
is O
there O
was O
a O
witness O
who O
uh O
had O
informed O
ship O
's O
authorities O
that O
she O
had O
heard O
a O
scream O
uh O
early B-MISC
that I-MISC
morning I-MISC
/. O

And O
what O
's O
really O
interesting O
is O
uh O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
she O
's O
been O
interviewed O
at O
this O
point O
/. O

But O
it O
was O
five B-MISC
days I-MISC
later I-MISC
that O
the O
ship O
's O
attorneys O
had O
begun O
to O
question O
her O
not O
law O
enforcement O
but O
ship O

attorneys O

will O

continue O

Thanks O
so O
much O
uh O
for O
coming O

We O
appreciate O
it O

Alright O
Erin B-PER
let O
me O
start O
with O
you O
/. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
the O
biggest O
problem O
is O
out O
there O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
these O
sex O
offenders O
/? O

Well O
I O
think O
that O
there O
's O
a O
gross O
misconception O
about O
sex O
offender O
crimes O
/. O

I O
think O
most O
do O
not O
realize O
how O
pervasive O
the O
problem O
is O
/. O

The O
sex O
offenders O
that O
we O
have O
caught O
are O
a O
very O
small O
percentage O
of O
those O
that O
are O
out O
there O
/. O

Statistically O
one B-MISC
in O
four B-MISC
girls O
and O
as O
many O
as O
one B-MISC
in O
six B-MISC
to O
ten B-MISC
boys O
are O
sexually O
assaulted O
before O
they O
are O
eighteen B-MISC
/. O

That O
's O
nationwide O
/. O

This O
problem O
is O
much O
bigger O
than O
I O
think O
people O
are O
realizing O
/. O

And O
Linda B-PER
I O
guess O
what O
we O
're O
realizing O
as O
we O
have O
been O
highlighting O
these O
wanted O
sex O
offenders O
around O
the O
country O
is O
how O
many O
of O
them O
are O
still O
out O
there O
and O
wanted O
/. O

Well O
currently O
there O
's O
um O
right O
now O
uh O
over B-MISC
a I-MISC
hundred I-MISC
thousand I-MISC
that O
are O
missing O
/. O

Unbelievable O
/. O

Uh O
we O
know O
that O
there O
's O
over B-MISC
five I-MISC
hundred I-MISC
thousand I-MISC
registered O
/. O

So O
yes O
there O
's O
a O
vast O
amount O
that O
are O
running O
uh O
through O
the O
system O
/. O

That O
's O
a O
May B-MISC
of I-MISC
two I-MISC
thousand I-MISC
five I-MISC
um O
statistic O
/. O

but O
as O
far O
as O
those O
before O
that O
time O
and O
date O
/. O

Um O
Linda B-PER
eh O
how O
much O
has O
this O
eh O
when O
I O
say O
changed O
your O
life O
I O
mean O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
obvious O
loss O
of O
your O
daughter O
but O
in O
terms O
of O
what O
you O
are O
doing O
everyday O
with O
your O
life O
/. O

both O
of O
you O
have O
devoted O
much O
of O
your O
lives O
to O
this O
cause O
now O
/. O

Linda B-PER
why O
do O
n't O
you O
tell O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
what O
you O
've O
been O
doing O
/. O

Well O
um O
I O
've O
been O
working O
with O
um O
er O
pardon O
me O
Byron B-PER
Dorgan I-PER
Senator O

North B-LOC

um O
working O
legislation O
on O
what O
has O
been O
uh O
called O
Dru B-MISC

Law I-MISC
which O
we O
hope O
will O
be O
a O
national O
sex O
+offender O
uh O
database O
through O
computer O
/. O

And O
um O
obviously O
we O
know O
that O
this O
nation O
is O
more O
and O
um O
they O
're O
able O
to O
access O
cross O
you O
know O
state O
lines O
/. O

so O
I O
think O
it O
's O
important O
that O
uh O
people O
of O
predators O
living O
amongst O
us O
across O
you O
know O
the O
country O
and O
be O
vigilant O
uh O
besides O
uh O
leaving O
the O
pressure O
on O
them O
/. O

Mhm O
/. O

Yeah O

Erin B-PER
uh O
every O
time O
I O
listen O
to O
that O

you O
um O
talking O

your O
dau- O
I O
get O
chills O
/. O

Um O
was O
it O
at O
all O
uh O
cathartic O
for O
you O
to O
be O
able O
to O
stand O
across O
from O
him O
/? O

Definitely O
/. O

Definitely O
I O
to O
say O
what O
I O
said O
to O
him O
/. O

I O
needed O
to O
address O
him O
/. O

And O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
got O
it O
off O
my O
chest O
you O
know O
/. O

I O
hope O
to O
never O
ever O
see O
him O
again O
/. O

The O
whole O
trial O
process O
is O
really O
built O
around O
the O
defendant O
/. O

and O
um O
it O
was O
very O
important O
to O
me O
that O
I O
bring O
it O
back O
around O
and O
make O
it O
about O
Samantha B-PER
because O
that O
's O
what O
it O
was O
really O
about O
/. O

Do O
you O
watch O
these O
other O
stories O
uh O
in O
the O
news O
/. O

and O
does O
it O
just O
get O
your O
blood O
boiling O
as O
you O
see O
eh O
these O
cases O
where O
was O
on O
the O

should O
have O
been O
arrested O
could O
've O
been O

You O
know O
the O
technology O
is O
there O
/. O

so O
yes O
it O
infuriates O
me O
/. O

I O
ca O
n't O
understand O
why O
we O
're O
so O
behind O
in O
terms O
of O
tracking O
sex O
offenders O
/. O

and O
I O
really O
think O
it O
's O
because O
people O
do O
n't O
real- O
/- O

there O
's O
no O
reason O
that O
there O
should O
n't O
be O

to O
stop O

have O
them O

I O
have O
to O
just O
on O

something O

we O
look O

do O

I O

`` O

wonder O
what O
kind O
of O
spin O
the O

On O

it O
would O

recognize O

Out O

The O
Communist B-MISC
Party O
began O
as O
a O
group O
of O
thugs O

scoundrels O
who O
killed O
to O

Once O
this O

In O
the O
East B-MISC
, O
people O
say O
, O
`` O
Do O

In O
the O
West B-MISC

people O
say O
, O
`` O
Love O

'' O

Conversely O
, O
the O
CCP B-ORG
holds O
that O
`` O

the O

Not O
only O
does O
the O
CCP B-ORG
take O

, O
it O
encourages O

It O
strives O
to O
desensitize O
people O
towards O
others O
' O
suffering O
by O
surrounding O
them O
with O
constant O

It O
wants O
them O
to O
become O
numb O
from O
frequent O
exposure O
to O
inhumane O
brutality O

and O
develop O
the O
mentality O
that O
`` O
the O

avoid O

'' O



All O
these O
lessons O
taught O
by O
brutal O
suppression O
enable O
the O
CCP B-ORG
to O
maintain O
its O
rule O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
destruction O
of O
countless O
lives O
, O
the O
CCP B-ORG
also O
destroyed O
the O
soul O
of O
the O
Chinese B-MISC

A O
great O

react O
to O
the O
CCP B-ORG

threats O
by O
entirely O

their O

In O

`` O

According O
to O
Kathy B-PER
Griggs I-PER
, O
this O
revolutionary O
terrorist O
group O
is O
controlling O
the O
Marines B-ORG

Army B-ORG

They O
all O
operate O
together O

They O
actually O
promoted O
communists B-MISC
in O
the O
OSS B-ORG
, O
which O
was O
started O
by O
William B-PER
Donovan I-PER

So O
they O
promote O
and O
use O
communists B-MISC
, O
who O
actually O
want O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
form O
of O

as O
a O
stepping O

So O
this O
group O
, O
now O
, O
in O
the O
Army B-ORG

Marine B-ORG
Corp. I-ORG
has O
communists B-MISC
at O
the O
very O
top O

One B-MISC
example O
of O
this O
truth O
is O
the O
goings O
on O

have O
not O
commited O

The O
military O
has O
a O
policy O
of O
`` O

whenever O
the O

After O

out O
the O

they O
are O
slated O
for O

But O
because O

be O

Perhaps O
the O

is O
soldiers O
do O
horrible O
things O
in O

things O
they O
would O
probably O
have O
never O

Most O

probably O
do O
try O
to O
moderate O
this O

just O
for O

ones O

But O
I O
bet O
such O

are O
far O
from O
the O

who O
can O
not O
be O

to O

their O

If O
the O

it O
is O
designed O
to O
prevent O
such O

designed O

kill O
you O

only O

that O

this O

The B-MISC
Boer I-MISC

first B-MISC

run O

British B-MISC

WWI B-MISC

WWII B-MISC

Berlin B-LOC

So O
, O
today O

there O
are O

The O

Repeat O

if O
dumb O

Americans B-MISC
did O
not O
want O
their O

they O

Except O
very O

the O

to O
stand O

And O
, O
you O
mean O

the O

now O
trying O
to O
hide O
the O
horrible O
, O
horrible O
fact O
that O
dozens B-MISC

maybe O
hundreds B-MISC
of O

were O
murdered O
in O
cold O

by O
US B-MISC

And O
this O

a O

Wake O

Ever O

Please O

there O

no O

just O
a O

realizing O

Why O
do O
you O
think O
only O
lowly O
soldiers O
and O
no O
generals O
have O
been O
convicted O
? O

Because O
generals O
have O
the O
power O

that O

why O
! O

So O
, O
one B-MISC
soldier O
stood O
up O

talked O
about O
some O
razed O
shithole O
in O
Iraq O
? O

Maybe O
he O
is O
going O
overboard O

creating O
a O

So O
what O
? O

That O

not O

that O

just O
some O

the O

In O

DA B-PER

speaking O

Is O

Please O

In O
your O

lesson O
-LRB- O
why O
not O
go O
back O
to O
the O
Romans B-MISC
who O
slaughtered O
everyone O
in O

or O
, O
for O
that O

, O
the O

in O
the O

slaughter O

-RRB- O
, O
you O
mention O
the O

of O
Dresden B-LOC

I O
'll O
toss O
in O
Hiroshima B-MISC

but O
those O

the O

trying O

shield O
her O

before O

Obviously O
, O
the O
pilots O
did O
n't O
think O
too O
much O
about O
what O
was O
happening O
on O
the O

or O
they O
would O

whether O

I O
'm O
sure O
there O
were O
GIs O
shooting O

in O
WW2 B-MISC
, O

but O
that O
kind O
of O
atrocity O
is O
not O
emblamatic O
of O
the O

in O
the O
way O
that O

Denying O
the O

the O

Yes O
, O
at O
the O
root O
of O
our O
monstrous O

is O
the O
loss O
of O
any O

the O

that O

surely O
one B-MISC

almost O

large O
as O
the O
EU B-ORG

They O
have O
a O
land O
area O
larger O
than O
either O
the O
US B-LOC
or O
all O
of O
Europe B-MISC

These O
22 B-MISC
countries O
, O
with O
all O
their O
oil O
and O
natural O
resources O
, O
have O
a O
combined O
GDP O
smaller O
than O
that O
of O
Netherlands B-LOC
plus O
Belgium B-LOC
and O
equal O
to O
half O
of O
the O
GDP O
of O
California B-LOC
alone O
. O

Within O
this O
meager O
GDP O
, O
the O
gaps O
between O
rich O
and O
poor O
are O
beyond O
belief O

and O
too O
many O
of O
the O
rich O
made O
their O
money O
not O
by O
succeeding O
in O
business O
, O
but O
by O
being O
corrupt O
rulers O
. O

The O
social O
status O
of O
women O
is O
far O
below O
what O
it O
was O
in O
the B-MISC
Western I-MISC
World I-MISC
150 B-MISC
years I-MISC
ago I-MISC
. O

Human O
rights O
are O
below O
any O
reasonable O
standard O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
grotesque O
fact O
that O
Libya B-LOC
was O
elected O
Chair O
of O
the B-ORG

According O
to O
a O
report O
prepared O
by O
a O
committee O
of O
Arab B-MISC
intellectuals O
and O
published O
under O
the O
auspices O
of O
the O
U.N. B-ORG
, O
the O
number O
of O
books O
translated O
by O
the O
entire O
Arab B-MISC
world O
is O
much O
smaller O
than O
what O
little O
Greece B-LOC
alone O
translates O
. O

The O
total O
number O
of O
scientific O
publications O
of O
300 B-MISC
million I-MISC
Arabs B-MISC
is O
less O
than O
that O
of O
6 B-MISC
million I-MISC
Israelis B-MISC
. O

Birth O
rates O
in O
the O
region O
are O
very O
high O
, O
increasing O
the O
poverty O
, O
the O
social O
gaps O
and O
the O
cultural O
decline O
. O

And O
all O
of O
this O
is O
happening O
in O
a O
region O
, O
which O
only O
30 B-MISC
years I-MISC
ago I-MISC
, O
was O
believed O
to O
be O
the O
next O
wealthy O
part O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
in O
a O
Moslem B-MISC
area O
, O
which O
developed O
, O
at O
some O
point O
in O
history O
, O
one B-MISC
of O
the O
most O
advanced O
cultures O
in O
the O
world O
. O

It O
is O
fair O
to O
say O
that O
this O
creates O
an O
unprecedented O
breeding O
ground O
for O
cruel O
dictators O
, O
terror O
networks O
, O
fanaticism O
, O
incitement O
, O
suicide O
murders O
and O
general O
decline O
. O

It O
is O
also O
a O
fact O
that O
almost O
everybody O
in O
the O
region O
blames O
this O
situation O
on O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
on O
Israel B-LOC
, O
on O
Western O
Civilization O
, O
on O
Judaism B-ORG
and O
Christianity B-ORG
, O
on O
anyone O
and O
anything O
, O
except O
themselves O
. O

A O
word O
about O
the O
millions B-MISC
of O
decent O
, O
honest O
, O
good O
people O
who O
are O
either O
devout O
Moslems B-MISC
or O
are O
not O
very O
religious O
but O
grew O
up O
in O
Moslem B-MISC
families O
: O

They O
are O
double O
victims O
of O
an O
outside O
world O
, O
which O
now O
develops O
Islamophobia O
, O
and O
of O
their O
own O
environment O
which O
breaks O
their O
heart O
by O
being O
totally O
dysfunctional O
. O



The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
vast O
silent O
majority O
of O
these O
Moslems B-MISC
are O
not O
part O
of O
the O
terror O
and O
the O
incitement O
, O
but O
they O
also O
do O
not O
stand O
up O
political O
leaders O
, O
intellectuals O
, O
business O
people O
and O
many O
others O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
can O
certainly O
tell O
right O
from O
wrong O
, O
but O
are O
afraid O
to O
express O
their O
views O
. O

The O
events O
of O
the B-MISC
last I-MISC
few I-MISC
years I-MISC
have O
amplified O
four B-MISC
issues O
, O
which O
have O
always O
existed O
, O
but O
have O
never O
been O
as O
rampant O
as O
in O
the O
present O
upheaval O
in O
the O
region O
. O

A B-MISC
few I-MISC
more I-MISC
years I-MISC
may O
pass O
before O
everybody O
acknowledges O
that O
it O
is O
a B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
, O

but O
we O
are O
already O
well O
into O
it O
. O

These O
are O
the O
four B-MISC
main O
pillars O
of O
the O
current O
World O
Conflict O
, O
or O
perhaps O
we O
should O
already O
refer O
to O
it O
as O
`` O
the O
undeclared O
World B-MISC
War I-MISC
III I-MISC
'' O
: O
against O
it O
. O
They O
become O
accomplices O
, O
by O
omission O
, O
and O
this O
applies O
to O

*1 O
. O

Suicide O
murders O
are O
not O
a O
new O
invention O

but O
they O
have O
been O
made O
popular O
, O
if O
I O
may O
use O
this O
expression O
, O
only O
lately O
. O

Even O
after O
September B-MISC
11 I-MISC
, O
it O
seems O
that O
most O
of O
the B-MISC
Western I-MISC
World I-MISC
does O
not O
yet O
understand O
this O
weapon O
. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
potent O
psychological O
weapon O
. O

Its O
real O
direct O
impact O
is O
relatively O
minor O
. O

The O
total O
number O
of O
casualties O
from O
hundreds B-MISC
of O
suicide O
murders O
within O
Israel B-LOC
in O
the B-MISC
last I-MISC
three I-MISC
years I-MISC
is O
much O
smaller O
than O
those O
due O
to O
car O
accidents O
. O

September O
11 O
was O
quantitatively O
much O
less O
lethal O
than O
many O
earthquakes O

More O
people O
die O
from O
AIDS O
in O
one B-MISC
day I-MISC
in O
Africa B-MISC
than O
all O
the O
Russians B-MISC
who O
died O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
Chechnya B-LOC
- O
based O
Moslem B-MISC
suicide O
murderers O
since O
that O
conflict O
started O
. O

Saddam B-PER
killed O
every O
month B-MISC
more O
people O
than O
all O
those O
who O
died O
from O
suicide O
murders O
since O
the O
Coalition B-ORG
occupation O
of O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

So O
what O
is O
all O
the O
fuss O
about O
suicide O
killings O
? O

It O
creates O
headlines O
. O

It O
is O
spectacular O
. O

It O
is O
frightening O
. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
cruel O
death O
with O
bodies O
dismembered O
and O
horrible O
severe O
lifelong O
injuries O
to O
many O
of O
the O
wounded O
. O

It O
is O
always O
shown O
on O
television O
in O
great O
detail O
. O

One O
such O
murder O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
hysterical O
media O
coverage O
, O
can O
destroy O
the O
tourism O
industry O
of O
a O
country O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
, O
as O
it O
did O
in O
Bali B-LOC
and O
in O
Turkey B-LOC
. O

But O
the O
real O
fear O
comes O
from O
the O
undisputed O
fact O
that O
no O
defense O
and O
no O
preventive O
measures O
can O
succeed O
against O
a O
determined O
suicide O
murderer O
. O

This O
has O
not O
yet O
penetrated O
the O
thinking O
of O
the B-MISC
Western I-MISC
World I-MISC
. O

The O
U.S. B-LOC
and O
Europe B-MISC
are O
constantly O
improving O
their O
defense O
against O
the O
last O
murder O
, O
not O
the O
next O
one O
. O

We O
may O
arrange O
for O
the O
best O
airport O
security O
in O
the O
world O
. O

But O
if O
you O
want O
to O
murder O
by O
suicide O
, O
you O
do O
not O
have O
to O
board O
a O
plane O
in O
order O
to O
explode O
yourself O
and O
kill O
many O
people O
. O

Who O
could O
stop O
a O
suicide O
murder O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
crowded O
line O
waiting O
to O
be O
checked O
by O
the O
airport O
metal O
detector O
? O

How O
about O
the O
lines O
to O
the O
check O
- O
in O
counters O
in O
a O
busy O
travel O
period O
? O

Put O
a O
metal O
detector O
in O
front O
of O
every O
train O
station O
in O
Spain B-LOC
and O
the O
terrorists O
will O
get O
the O
buses O
. O

Protect O
the O
buses O
and O
they O
will O
explode O
in O
movie O
theaters O
, O
concert O
halls O
, O
supermarkets O
, O
shopping O
malls O
, O
schools O
and O
hospitals O
. O

Put O
guards O
in O
front O
of O
every O
concert O
hall O
and O
there O
will O
always O
be O
a O
line O
of O
people O
to O
be O
checked O
by O
the O
guards O

and O
this O
line O
will O
be O
the O
target O
, O
not O
to O
speak O
of O
killing O
the O
guards O
themselves O
. O

You O
can O
somewhat O
reduce O
your O
vulnerability O
by O
preventive O
and O
defensive O
measures O
and O
by O
strict O
border O
controls O
but O
not O
eliminate O
it O
and O
definitely O
not O
win O
the O
war O
in O
a O
defensive O
way O
. O

And O
it O
is O
a O
war O
! O

What O
is O
behind O
the O
suicide O
murders O
? O

Money O
is O
, O
money O
and O
power O
and O
cold O
- O
blooded O
murderous O
incitement O
, O
nothing O
else O
. O

It O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
true O
fanatic O
religious O
beliefs O
. O

No O
Moslem B-MISC
preacher O
has O
ever O
blown O
himself O
up O
. O

No O
son O
of O
an O
Arab B-MISC
politician O
or O
religious O
leader O
has O
ever O
blown O
himself O
up O
. O

No O
relative O
of O
anyone O
influential O
has O
done O
it O
. O

Would O
n't O
you O
expect O
some O
of O
the O
religious O
leaders O
to O
do O
it O
themselves O
, O
or O
to O
talk O
their O
sons O
into O
doing O
it O
, O
if O
this O
is O
truly O
a O
supreme O
act O
of O
religious O
fervor O
? O

Are O
n't O
they O
interested O
in O
the O
benefits O
of O
going O
to O
Heaven O
? O

Instead O
, O
they O
send O
outcast O
women O
, O
naive O
children O
, O
retarded O
people O
and O
young O
incited O
hotheads O
. O

They O
promise O
them O
the O
delights O
, O
mostly O
sexual O
, O
of O
the O
next O
world O
, O
and O
pay O
their O
families O
handsomely O
after O
the O
supreme O
act O
is O
performed O
and O
enough O
innocent O
people O
are O
dead O
. O

Suicide O
murders O
also O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
poverty O
and O
despair O
. O

The O
poorest O
region O
in O
the O
world O
, O
by O
far O
, O
is O
Africa B-ORG
. O

It O
never O
happens O
there O
. O

There O
are O
numerous O
desperate O
people O
in O
the O
world O
, O
in O
different O
cultures O
, O
countries O
and O
continents O
. O

Desperation O
does O
not O
provide O
anyone O
with O
explosives O
, O
reconnaissance O
and O
transportation O
. O

There O
was O
certainly O
more O
despair O
in O
Saddam B-PER
's O
Iraq B-LOC
than O
in O
Paul B-PER
Bremmer I-PER
's I-PER
Iraq B-LOC
, O

and O
no O
one O
exploded O
himself O
. O

A O
suicide O
murder O
is O
simply O
a O
horrible O
, O
vicious O
weapon O
of O
cruel O
, O
inhuman O
, O
cynical O
, O
well O
- O
funded O
terrorists O
, O
with O
no O
regard O
to O
human O
life O
, O
including O
the O
life O
of O
their O
fellow O
countrymen O
, O
but O
with O
very O
high O
regard O
to O
their O
own O
affluent O
well O
- O
being O
and O
their O
hunger O
for O
power O
. O

The O
only O
way O
to O
fight O
this O
new O
`` O
popular O
'' O
weapon O
is O
identical O
to O
the O
only O
way O
in O
which O
you O
fight O
organized O
crime O
or O
pirates O
on O
the O
high O
seas O
: O
the O
offensive O
way O
. O



Like O
in O
the O
case O
of O
organized O
crime O
, O
it O
is O
crucial O
that O
the O
forces O
on O
the O
offensive O
be O
united O
and O
it O
is O
crucial O
to O
reach O
the O
top O
of O
the O
crime O
pyramid O
. O

You O
can O
not O
eliminate O
organized O
crime O
by O
arresting O
the O
little O
drug O
dealer O
on O
the O
street O
corner O
. O

You O
must O
go O
after O
the O
head O
of O
the O
`` O
Family O
'' O
. O

If O
part O
of O
the O
public O
supports O
it O
, O
others O
tolerate O
it O
, O
many O
are O
afraid O
of O
it O
and O
some O
try O
to O
explain O
it O
away O
by O
poverty O
or O
by O
a O
miserable O
childhood O
, O
organized O
crime O
will O
thrive O
and O
so O
will O
terrorism O

The B-LOC
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
understands O
this O
now O
, O
after O
September B-MISC
11 I-MISC
. O

Russia B-LOC
is O
beginning O
to O
understand O
it O
. O

Turkey B-LOC
understands O
it O
well O
. O

I O
am O
very O
much O
afraid O
that O
most O
of O
Europe B-MISC
still O
does O
not O
understand O
it O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
Europe B-MISC
will O
understand O
it O
only O
after O
suicide O
murders O
arrive O
in O
Europe B-MISC
in O
a O
big O
way O
. O

In O
my O
humble O
opinion O
, O
this O
will O
definitely O
happen O
. O

The O
Spanish B-MISC
trains O
and O
the O
Istanbul B-LOC
bombings O
are O
only O
the O
beginning O
. O

The O
unity O
of O
the O
Civilized O
World O
in O
fighting O
this O
horror O
is O
absolutely O
indispensable O
. O

Until O
Europe B-MISC
wakes O
up O
, O
this O
unity O
will O
not O
be O
achieved O

Words O
can O
be O
lethal O

They O
kill O
people O

It O
is O
often O
said O
that O
politicians O
, O
diplomats O
and O
perhaps O
also O
lawyers O
and O
business O
people O
must O
sometimes O
lie O
, O
as O
part O
of O
their O
professional O
life O
. O

But O
the O
norms O
of O
politics O
and O
diplomacy O
are O
childish O
, O
in O
comparison O
with O
the O
level O
of O
incitement O
and O
total O
absolute O
deliberate O
fabrications O
, O
which O
have O
reached O
new O
heights O
in O
the O
region O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
. O

An O
incredible O
number O
of O
people O
in O
the O
Arab B-MISC
world O
believe O
that O
September B-MISC
11 I-MISC
never O
happened O
, O
or O
was O
an O
American B-MISC
provocation O
or O
, O
even O
better O
, O
a O
Jewish B-MISC
plot O
. O

You O
all O
remember O
the O
Iraqi O
Minister O
of O
Information O
, O
Mr. O
Mouhamad B-PER
Said I-PER
al-Sahaf I-PER
and O
his O
press O
conferences O
when O
the O
US B-MISC
forces O
were O
already O
inside O
Baghdad B-LOC
. O

Disinformation O
at O
time O
of O
war O
is O
an O
accepted O
tactic O
. O

But O
to O
stand O
, O
day O
after O
day O
, O
and O
to O
make O
such O
preposterous O
statements O
, O
known O
to O
everybody O
to O
be O
lies O
, O
without O
even O
being O
ridiculed O
in O
your O
own O
milieu O
, O
can O
only O
happen O
in O
this O
region O
. O

Mr. O
Sahaf B-PER
eventually O
became O
a O
popular O
icon O
as O
a O
court O
jester O
, O

but O
this O
did O
not O
stop O
some O
allegedly O
respectable O
newspapers O
from O
giving O
him O
equal O
time O
. O

It O
also O
does O
not O
prevent O
the O
Western O
press O
from O
giving O
credence O
, O
every O
day O
, O
even O
now O
, O
to O
similar O
liars O
. O

After O
all O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
an O
anti-Semite O
, O
there O
are O
subtle O
ways O
of O
doing O
it O
. O

You O
do O
not O
have O
to O
claim O
that O
the O
holocaust B-MISC
never O
happened O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Jewish B-MISC
temple O
in O
Jerusalem B-LOC
never O
existed O
. O

But O
millions B-MISC
of O
Moslems B-MISC
are O
told O
by O
their O
leaders O
that O
this O
is O
the O
case O
. O

When O
these O
same O
leaders O
make O
other O
statements O
, O
the O
Western O
media O
report O
them O
as O
if O
they O
could O
be O
true O
. O

It O
is O
a O
daily O
occurrence O
that O
the O
same O
people O
who O
finance O

dispatch O
suicide O

condemn O
the O

It O

the O
Western O

it O
because O
its O
own O
TV O

are O
mostly O

to O

I O
recommend O
to O
you O
, O
even O
though O
most O
of O
you O
do O
not O
understand O
Arabic B-MISC
, O
to O
watch O
Al B-ORG

from O
time O
to O

You O
will O
not O

your O

But O
words O
also O
work O
in O
other O
ways O

more O
subtle O

A O
demonstration O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
carrying O
banners O
supporting O
Saddam B-PER
's O
regime O
and O
featuring O
three B-MISC
- I-MISC
year I-MISC
old I-MISC
babies O
dressed O
as O
suicide O
murderers O
, O
is O
defined O
by O
the O
press O
and O
by O
political O
leaders O
as O
a O
`` O
peace O
demonstration O
'' O
. O

You O
may O
support O
or O
oppose O
the B-MISC
Iraq I-MISC
war I-MISC
, O
but O
to O
refer O
to O
fans O
of O
Saddam B-PER
, O
Arafat B-PER
or O
Bin B-PER
Laden I-PER
as O
peace O
activists O
is O
a O
bit O
too O
much O
. O

A O
woman O
walks O
into O
an O
Israeli B-MISC
restaurant O
in O
mid-day O
, O
eats O
, O
observes O
families O
with O
old O
people O
and O
children O
eating O
their O
lunch O
in O
the O
adjacent O
tables O
and O
pays O
the O
bill O
. O

She O
then O
blows O
herself O
up O
, O
killing O
20 B-MISC
people O
, O
including O
many O
children O
, O
with O
heads O
and O
arms O
rolling O
around O
in O
the O
restaurant O
. O

She O
is O
called O
`` O
martyr O
'' O
by O
several O
Arab B-MISC
leaders O
and O
`` O

by O
the O
European B-MISC
press O

Dignitaries O
condemn O
the O
act O
but O
visit O
her O
bereaved O
family O
and O
the O
money O
flows O

There O
is O
a O
new O
game O
in O
town O
: O

The O
actual O
murderer O
is O
called O
`` O
the O
military O
wing O
'' O
, O

the O
one O
who O
pays O
him O
, O
equips O
him O
and O
sends O
him O
is O
now O
called O
`` O
the O
political O
wing O
'' O

and O
the O
head O
of O
the O
operation O
is O
called O
the O
`` O
spiritual O
leader O
'' O
. O

There O
are O
numerous O
other O
examples O
of O
such O
Orwellian O
nomenclature O
, O
used O
every O
day O
not O
only O
by O
terror O
chiefs O
but O
also O
by O
Western O
media O
. O

These O
words O
are O
much O
more O
dangerous O
than O
many O
people O
realize O
. O

They O
provide O
an O
emotional O
infrastructure O
for O
atrocities O
. O

It O
was O
Joseph B-PER
Goebbels I-PER
who O
said O
that O
if O
you O
repeat O
a O
lie O
often O
enough O
, O
people O
will O

it O

is O

Huge O
amounts O
of O
money O
, O
which O
could O
have O
solved O
many O
social O
problems O
in O
this O
dysfunctional O
part O
of O
the O
world O
, O
are O
channeled O
into O
three B-MISC
concentric O
spheres O
supporting O
death O
and O
murder O
. O

In O
the O
inner O
circle O
are O
the O
terrorists O
themselves O
. O

The O
money O
funds O
their O
travel O
, O
explosives O
, O
hideouts O
and O
permanent O
search O
for O
soft O
vulnerable O
targets O
. O

The O
inner O
circles O
are O
primarily O
financed O
by O
terrorist O
states O
like O
Iran B-LOC
and O
Syria B-LOC
, O
until O
recently O
also O
by O
Iraq B-LOC
and O
Libya B-LOC
and O
earlier O
also O
by O
some O
of O
the O
Communist B-MISC
regimes O
. O

These O
states O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the B-ORG
Palestinian I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
, O
are O
the O
safe O
havens O
of O
the O
wholesale O
murder O
vendors O
. O

They O
are O
surrounded O
by O
a O
second B-MISC
wider O
circle O
of O
direct O
supporters O
, O
planners O
, O
commanders O
, O
preachers O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
make O
a O
living O
, O
usually O
a O
very O
comfortable O
living O
, O
by O
serving O
as O
terror O
infrastructure O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
find O
the O
third B-MISC
circle O
of O
so O
- O
called O
religious O
, O
educational O
and O
welfare O
organizations O
, O
which O
actually O
do O
some O
good O
, O
feed O
the O
hungry O
and O
provide O
some O
schooling O
, O
but O
brainwash O
a O
new O
generation O
with O
hatred O
, O
lies O
and O
ignorance O
. O

This O
circle O
operates O
mostly O
through O
mosques O
, O
madrasas O
and O
other O
religious O
establishments O
but O
also O
through O
inciting O
electronic O
and O
printed O
media O
. O

It O
is O
this O
circle O
that O
makes O
sure O
that O
women O
remain O
inferior O
, O
that O
democracy O
is O
unthinkable O
and O
that O
exposure O
to O
the O
outside O
world O
is O
minimal O
. O

It O
is O
also O
that O
circle O
that O
leads O
the O
way O
in O
blaming O
everybody O
outside O
the O
Moslem B-MISC
world O
, O
for O
the O
miseries O
of O
the O
region O
. O

The O
outer O
circle O
is O
largely O
financed O
by O
Saudi B-LOC
Arabia I-LOC
, O
but O
also O
by O
donations O
from O
certain O
Moslem B-MISC
communities O
in O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
Europe B-MISC
and O
, O
to O
a O
smaller O
extent O
, O
by O
donations O
of O
European B-MISC
Governments O
to O
various O
NGO's O
and O
by O
certain O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
organizations O
, O
whose O
goals O
may O
be O
noble O
, O
but O
they O
are O
infested O
and O
exploited O
by O
agents O
of O
the O
outer O
circle O
. O

The O
Saudi B-MISC
regime O
, O
of O
course O
, O
will O
be O
the O
next O
victim O
of O
major O
terror O
, O
when O
the O
inner O
circle O
will O
explode O
into O
the O
outer O
circle O
. O

The O
Saudis B-MISC
are O
beginning O
to O
understand O
it O
, O
but O
they O
fight O
the O
inner O
circles O
, O
while O
still O
financing O
the O
infrastructure O
at O
the O
outer O
circle O
. O

Figuratively O
speaking O
, O
this O
outer O
circle O
is O
the O
guardian O
, O
which O
makes O
sure O
that O
the O
people O
look O
and O
listen O
inwards O
to O
the O
inner O
circle O
of O
terror O
and O
incitement O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
the O
world O
outside O
. O

Some O
parts O
of O
this O
same O
outer O
circle O
actually O
operate O
as O
a O
result O
of O
fear O
from O
, O
or O
blackmail O
by O
, O
the O
inner O
circles O
. O

The O
horrifying O
added O
factor O
is O
the O
high O
birth O
rate O
. O

Half B-MISC
of O
the O
population O
of O
the O
Arab B-MISC
world O
is O
under O
the O
age O
of O
20 B-MISC

the O
most O
receptive O
age O
to O
incitement O

two B-MISC

generations O

Some O
of O
the O
leaders O

these O

very O

Every O

how O
you O
prevent O
an O
anti-democratic O
force O
from O
winning O
a O
democratic O
election O
and O
abolishing O
democracy O
. O

Other O
aspects O
of O
a O
civilized O
society O
must O
also O
have O
limitations O
. O

Can O
a O
policeman O
open O
fire O
on O
someone O

him O
? O

Can O
a O
government O
listen O
to O

Does O
free O
speech O
protect O
you O
when O
you O

in O

Should O
there O
be O
death O

for O
deliberate O

? O

These O
are O
the O
old O
- O
fashioned O
dilemmas O
. O

But O
now O
we O
have O
an O
entire O
new O
set O
. O

Do O
you O
raid O
a O
mosque O
, O
which O
serves O
as O
a O
terrorist O
ammunition O
storage O
? O

Do O
you O
return O
fire O
, O
if O
you O
are O
attacked O
from O
a O
hospital O
? O

Do O
you O
storm O
a O
church O
taken O
over O
by O
terrorists O
who O
took O
the O
priests O
hostages O
? O

Do O
you O
search O
every O
ambulance O
after O
a O
few O
suicide O
murderers O
use O
ambulances O
to O
reach O
their O
targets O
? O

Do O
you O
strip O
every O
woman O
because O
one O
pretended O
to O
be O
pregnant O
and O
carried O
a O
suicide O
bomb O
on O
her O
belly O
? O

Do O
you O
shoot O
back O
at O
someone O
trying O
to O
kill O
you O
, O
standing O
deliberately O
behind O
a O
group O
of O
children O
? O

Do O
you O
raid O
terrorist O
headquarters O
, O
hidden O
in O
a O
mental O
hospital O
? O

Do O
you O
shoot O
an O
arch-murderer O
who O
deliberately O
moves O
from O
one O
location O
to O
another O
, O
always O
surrounded O
by O
children O
? O

All O
of O
these O
happen O
daily O
in O
Iraq B-LOC

in O
the O
Palestinian B-MISC
areas O
. O

What O
do O
you O
do O
? O

Well O
, O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
face O
the O
dilemma O
. O

But O
it O
can O
not O
be O
avoided O
. O



Suppose O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
discussion O
, O
that O
someone O
would O
openly O
stay O
in O
a O
well O

known O
address O
in O
Teheran B-LOC

it O

treat O
him O
as O
a O
great O

I O
leave O
it O
to O
you O
as O
homework O
to O
figur O
out O
what O
Spain B-LOC
or O
France B-LOC
would O
have O
done O
, O
in O
such O
a O
situation O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
civilized O
world O
is O
still O
having O
illusions O
about O
the O
rule O
of O
law O
in O
a O
totally O
lawless O
environment O
. O

It O
is O
trying O
to O
play O
ice O
hockey O
by O
sending O
a O
ballerina O
ice O

skater O
into O
the O
ring O
or O
to O
knock O
out O
a O
heavyweight O
boxer O
by O
a O
chess O
player O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
that O
no O
country O
has O
a O
law O
against O
cannibals O
eating O
its O
prime O
minister O
, O
because O
such O
an O
act O
is O
unthinkable O
, O
international O
law O
does O
not O
address O
killers O
shooting O
from O
hospitals O
, O
mosques O
and O
ambulances O
, O
while O
being O
protected O
by O
their O
Government O
or O
society O
. O

International O
law O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
handle O
someone O
who O
sends O
children O
to O
throw O
stones O
, O
stands O
behind O
them O
and O
shoots O
with O
immunity O
and O
can O
not O
be O
arrested O
because O
he O
is O
sheltered O
by O
a O
Government O
. O

International O
law O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
leader O
of O
murderers O
who O
is O
royally O
and O
comfortably O
hosted O
by O
a O
country O
, O
which O
pretends O
to O
condemn O
his O
acts O
or O
just O
claims O
to O
be O
too O
weak O
to O
arrest O
him O
. O

The O
amazing O
thing O
is O
that O
all O
of O
these O
crooks O
demand O
protection O
under O
international O
law O
, O
and O
define O
all O
those O
who O
attack O
them O
as O
`` O
war O
criminals O
, O
'' O
with O
some O
Western O
media O
repeating O
the O
allegations O
. O

The O
good O
news O
is O
that O
all O
of O
this O
is O
temporary O
, O

because O
the O
evolution O
of O
international O
law O
has O
always O
adapted O
itself O
to O
reality O
. O

The O
punishment O
for O
suicide O
murder O
should O
be O
death O
or O
arrest O
before O
the O
murder O
, O
not O
during O
and O
not O
after O
. O

After O
every O
world O
war O
, O
the O
rules O
of O
international O
law O
have O
changed O
, O
and O
the O
same O
will O
happen O
after O
the O
present O
one O
. O

But O
during O
the O
twilight O
zone O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
harm O
can O
be O
done O
. O

The O
picture O
I O
described O
here O
is O
not O
pretty O
. O

What O
can O
we O
do O
about O
it O
? O

In O
the O
short O
run O
, O
only O
fight O
and O
win O
. O

In O
the O
long O
run O
, O
only O
educate O
the O
next O
generation O
and O
open O
it O
to O
the O
world O
. O

The O
inner O
circles O
can O
and O
must O
be O
destroyed O
by O
force O
. O

The O
outer O
circle O
can O
not O
be O
eliminated O
by O
force O
. O

Here O
we O
need O
financial O
starvation O
of O
the O
organizing O
elite O
, O
more O
power O
to O
women O
, O
more O
education O
, O
counter-propaganda O
, O
boycott O
whenever O
feasible O
and O
access O
to O
Western O
media O
, O
internet O
and O
the O
international O
scene O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
we O
need O
a O
total O
absolute O
unity O
and O
determination O
of O
the O
civilized O
world O
against O
all O
three B-MISC
circles O
of O
evil O
. O

Allow O
me O
, O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
to O
depart O
from O
my O
alleged O
role O
as O
a O
taxi O
driver O
and O
return O
to O
science O
. O

When O
you O
have O
a O
malignant O
tumor O
, O
you O
may O
remove O
the O
tumor O
itself O
surgically O
. O

You O
may O
also O
starve O
it O
by O
preventing O
new O
blood O
from O
reaching O
it O
from O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
body O
, O
thereby O
preventing O
new O
`` O
supplies O
'' O
from O
expanding O
the O
tumor O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
is O
best O
to O
do O
both O
. O

But O
before O
you O
fight O
and O
win O
, O
by O
force O
or O
otherwise O
, O
you O
have O
to O
realize O
that O
you O
are O
in O
a O
war O
, O
and O
this O
may O
take O
Europe B-MISC
a B-MISC
few I-MISC
more I-MISC
years I-MISC
. O

In O
order O
to O
win O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
first B-MISC
eliminate O
the O
terrorist O
regimes O
, O
so O
that O
no O
Government O
in O
the O
world O
will O
serve O
as O
a O
safe O
haven O
for O
these O
people O
. O

I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
comment O
here O
on O
whether O
the O
American B-MISC
- O
led O
attack O
on O
Iraq B-LOC
was O
justified O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
or O
any O
other O
pre-war O
argument O
, O
but O
I O
can O
look O
at O
the O
post-war O
map O
of O
Western B-MISC
Asia I-MISC
. O

Now O
that O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
Iraq B-LOC
and O
Libya B-LOC
are O
out O
, O
two B-MISC
and I-MISC
a I-MISC
half I-MISC
terrorist O
states O
remain O
: O
Iran B-LOC
, O
Syria B-LOC
and O
Lebanon B-LOC
, O
the O
latter O
being O
a O
Syrian B-MISC
colony O
. O

Perhaps O
Sudan B-LOC
should O
be O
added O
to O
the O
list O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
conquest O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
and O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
both O
Iran B-LOC
and O
Syria B-LOC
are O
now O
totally O
surrounded O
by O
territories O
unfriendly O
to O
them O
. O

Iran B-LOC
is O
encircled O
by O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
by O
the B-LOC
Gulf I-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
Iraq B-LOC
and O
the O
Moslem B-MISC
republics O
of O
the O
former O
Soviet B-LOC
Union I-LOC
. O

Syria B-LOC
is O
surrounded O
by O
Turkey B-LOC
, O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
Jordan B-LOC
and O
Israel B-LOC
. O

This O
is O
a O
significant O
strategic O
change O
and O
it O
applies O
strong O
pressure O
on O
the O
terrorist O
countries O
. O

It O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
Iran B-LOC
is O
so O
active O
in O
trying O
to O
incite O
a O
Shiite B-MISC
uprising O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
the O
American B-MISC
plan O
was O
actually O
to O
encircle O
both O
Iran B-LOC
and O
Syria B-LOC
, O
but O
that O
is O
the O
resulting O
situation O
. O

In O
my O
humble O
opinion O
, O
the O
number O
one B-MISC
danger O
to O
the O
world O
today O
is O
Iran B-LOC
and O
its O
regime O
. O

It O
definitely O
has O
ambitions O
to O
rule O
vast O
areas O
and O
to O
expand O
in O
all O
directions O
. O

It O
has O
an O
ideology O
which O
claims O
supremacy O
over O
Western O
culture O
. O

It O
is O
ruthless O
. O

It O
has O
proven O
that O
it O
can O
execute O
elaborate O
terrorist O
acts O
without O
leaving O
too O
many O
traces O
, O
using O
Iranian B-MISC
Embassies O
. O

It O
is O
clearly O
trying O
to O
develop O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

Its O
so O
- O
called O
moderates O
and O
conservatives O
play O
their O
own O
virtuoso O
version O
of O
the O
`` O
good O
- O
cop O
versus O
bad O
- O
cop O
'' O
game O
. O



Iran B-LOC
sponsors O
Syrian B-MISC
terrorism O
, O

it O
is O
certainly O
behind O
much O
of O
the O
action O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
, O

it O
is O
fully O
funding O
the O
Hezbollah B-ORG
and O
, O
through O
it O
, O
the O
Palestinian B-MISC
Hamas B-ORG
and O
Islamic B-ORG
Jihad I-ORG
; O

it O
performed O
acts O
of O
terror O
at O
least O
in O
Europe B-MISC
and O
in O
South B-MISC
America I-MISC
and O
probably O
also O
in O
Uzbekistan B-LOC
and O
Saudi B-LOC
Arabia I-LOC

and O
it O
truly O
leads O
a O
multi-national O
terror O
consortium O
, O
which O
includes O
, O
as O
minor O
players O
, O
Syria B-LOC
, O
Lebanon B-LOC
and O
certain O
Shiite B-MISC
elements O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
most O
European B-MISC
countries O
still O
trade O
with O
Iran B-LOC
, O
try O
to O
appease O
it O
and O
refuse O
to O
read O
the O
clear O
signals O
. O

In O
order O
to O
win O
the O
war O
it O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
dry O
the O
financial O
resources O
of O
the O
terror O
conglomerate O
. O

It O
is O
pointless O
to O
try O
to O
understand O
the O
subtle O
differences O
between O
the O
Sunni B-MISC
terror O
of O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
and O
Hamas B-ORG
and O
the O
Shiite B-MISC
terror O
of O
Hezbollah B-ORG
, O
Sadr B-ORG
and O
other O
Iranian B-MISC
- O
inspired O
enterprises O
. O

When O
it O
serves O
their O
business O
needs O
, O
all O
of O
them O
collaborate O
beautifully O
. O

It O
is O
crucial O
to O
stop O
Saudi B-MISC
and O
other O
financial O
support O
of O
the O
outer O
circle O
, O
which O
is O
the O
fertile O
breeding O
ground O
of O
terror O
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
monitor O
all O
donations O
from O
the O
Western O
World O
to O
Islamic B-MISC
organizations O
, O
to O
monitor O
the O
finances O
of O
international O
relief O
organizations O
and O
to O
react O
with O
forceful O
economic O
measures O
to O
any O
small O
sign O
of O
financial O
aid O
to O
any O
of O
the O
three O
circles O
of O
terrorism O
. O

It O
is O
also O
important O
to O
act O
decisively O
against O
the O
campaign O
of O
lies O
and O
fabrications O
and O
to O
monitor O
those O
Western O
media O
who O
collaborate O
with O
it O
out O
of O
naivety O
, O
financial O
interests O
or O
ignorance O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
never O
surrender O
to O
terror O
. O

No O
one O
will O
ever O
know O
whether O
the O
recent O
elections O
in O
Spain B-LOC
would O
have O
yielded O
a O
different O
result O
, O
if O
not O
for O
the O
train O
bombings O
a B-MISC
few I-MISC
days I-MISC
earlier I-MISC
. O

But O
it O
really O
does O
not O
matter O
. O

What O
matters O
is O
that O
the O
terrorists O
believe O
that O
they O
caused O
the O
result O
and O
that O
they O
won O
by O
driving O
Spain B-LOC
out O
of O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

The O
Spanish B-MISC
story O
will O
surely O
end O
up O
being O
extremely O
costly O
to O
other O
European B-MISC
countries O
, O
including O
France B-LOC
, O
who O
is O
now O
expelling O
inciting O
preachers O
and O
forbidding O
veils O
and O
including O
others O
who O
sent O
troops O
to O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
long O
run O
, O
Spain B-LOC
itself O
will O
pay O
even O
more O
. O

Is O
the O
solution O
a O
democratic O
Arab B-MISC
world O
? O

If O
by O
democracy O
we O
mean O
free O
elections O
but O
also O
free O
press O
, O
free O
speech O
, O
a O
functioning O
judicial O
system O
, O
civil O
liberties O
, O
equality O
to O
women O
, O
free O
international O
travel O
, O
exposure O
to O
international O
media O
and O
ideas O
, O
laws O
against O
racial O
incitement O
and O
against O
defamation O
, O
and O
avoidance O
of O
lawless O
behavior O
regarding O
hospitals O
, O
places O
of O
worship O
and O
children O
, O
then O
yes O
, O
democracy O
is O
the O
solution O
. O

If O
democracy O
is O
just O
free O
elections O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
most O
fanatic O
regime O
will O
be O
elected O
, O
the O
one O
whose O
incitement O
and O
fabrications O
are O
the O
most O
inflammatory O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
it O
already O
in O
Algeria B-LOC
and O
, O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
, O
in O
Turkey B-LOC
. O

It O
will O
happen O
again O
, O
if O
the O
ground O
is O
not O
prepared O
very O
carefully O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
a O
certain O
transition O
democracy O
, O
as O
in O
Jordan B-LOC
, O
may O
be O
a O
better O
temporary O
solution O
, O
paving O
the O
way O
for O
the O
real O
thing O
, O
perhaps O
in O
the O
same O
way O
that O
an O
immediate O
sudden O
democracy O
did O
not O
work O
in O
Russia B-LOC
and O
would O
not O
have O
worked O
in O
China B-LOC
. O

I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
civilized O
world O
will O
prevail O
. O

But O
the O
longer O
it O
takes O
us O
to O
understand O
the O
new O
landscape O
of O
this O
war O
, O
the O
more O
costly O
and O
painful O
the O
victory O
will O
be O
. O

Its O
understandable O
recoil O
from O
wars O
, O
following O
the O
horrors O
of O
World B-MISC
War I-MISC
II I-MISC
, O
may O
cost O
thousands B-MISC
of O
additional O
innocent O
lives O
, O
before O
the O
tide O
will O
turn O
. O




Over O
a O
month O
ago O
, O
the O
experienced O
Iraqi B-MISC
politician O
Adnan B-PER
Pachachi I-PER
doubted O
Prime O
Minister O
Nouri B-PER
Al I-PER
- I-PER
Malaki I-PER
's O
ability O
to O
carry O
out O
his O
promise O
to O
disband O
the O

said O
that O
Al B-PER

Maliki I-PER

in O
one O
corner O

his O

whether O

were O
in O
another O
corner O
in O

of O
their O
allegiance O
to O
parties O
that O
have O
armed O
militias O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
Pachachi B-PER
's O
conclusions O
are O
nothing O
new O
for O
the O
Iraqi B-MISC
situation O
that O
has O
reached O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
bottomless O
pit O
because O
of O
these O
militias O
whose O
existence O
the O
Iraqi B-MISC
man O
on O
the O
street O
can O
no O
longer O
tolerate O
as O
they O
have O
turned O
his O
life O
into O
a O
hell O
worse O
than O
the O
fire O
of O
Saddam B-PER

bloody O

And O
while O
Al B-PER

reached O
a O
new O
level O
of O
confrontation O
in O
his O
attack O
in O

when O

Phobias O
occur O
in O
both O
genders O
in O
the O
ages O
ranging O
between O
twenty B-MISC
and O
thirty B-MISC
years I-MISC
old I-MISC
; O
they O
very O
rarely O
occur O
in O
adolescents O
. O

Also O
, O
no O
cases O
have O
been O
recorded O
among O
children O
; O
they O
rarely O
occur O
in O
children O
. O

Nervous O
phobias O
usually O
happen O
at O
night O
, O
with O
the O
patient O
waking O
up O
with O
fast O
and O
pounding O
heartbeats O
, O
and O
feeling O
as O
if O
he O
were O
suffering O
a O
heart O
attack O
because O
of O
the O
chest O
pains O
, O
profuse O
sweating O
, O
and O
abnormal O
heart O
activity O
that O
accompanies O
fear O
and O
strong O
panic O
attacks O
. O

The O
most O
common O
kind O
of O
phobia O
is O
the O
fear O
of O
high O
places O
and O
areas O
-LRB- O
Acrophobia O
-RRB- O
. O

Fear O
of O
heights O
is O
the O
most O
common O
type O
of O
phobia O
. O

A O
patient O
could O
be O
subject O
to O
losing O
his O
balance O
and O
then O
falling O
. O

So O
any O
healthy O
person O
is O
advised O
not O
to O
insist O
that O
an O
acrophobic O
accompany O
him O
to O
high O
places O
, O
as O
he O
does O
not O
feel O
the O
extent O
of O
his O
pain O
and O
emotion O
, O
and O
both O
might O
get O
hurt O
. O

Airplanes O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
skyscrapers O
, O
are O
among O
the O
causes O
of O
this O
phobia O
, O
as O
well O
as O
high O
rides O
in O
amusement O
parks O
, O
mountains O
and O
roads O
overlooking O
slopes O
or O
bridges O
. O

A O
person O
does O
not O
necessarily O
have O
to O
be O
in O
a O
high O
place O
to O
experience O
the O
symptoms O
of O
this O
phobia O
. O

It O
is O
enough O
for O
him O
to O
see O
, O
for O
example O
, O
a O
skyscraper O
to O
immediately O
have O
the O
symptoms O
, O
even O
if O
he O
is O
safe O
on O
the O
ground O

We O
had O
never O
seen O

we O
had O
never O
experienced O

we O
had O
never O
read O

we O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
a O
Saudi B-MISC

whether O
secular O

liberal O
, O
modernized O

enlightened O
, O
or O
even O
a O

who O
writes O

with O
ideas O

whether O

We O
never O
heard O
about O
any O
of O
those O
who O
confronted O
the O
state O
or O
carried O
a O
rifle O
and O
a O
bomb O
and O
adopted O
the O
policy O
of O
bombing O
and O
terrorism O
to O
change O
the O
status O
of O
the O
state O
, O
or O
acted O
barbarically O
and O
broke O
his O
pen O
to O
carry O
a O
stick O
instead O
, O
and O
confined O
the O
thoughts O
of O
others O
with O
it O
in O
order O
to O
lead O
a O
change O
by O
his O
hand O
, O
instead O
of O
by O
his O
ideas O
. O

The O
Islamic B-MISC
movement O
does O
not O
lack O
ideas O
to O
confront O
others O
, O
if O
it O
is O
truly O
honest O
in O
adopting O
angelic O
Islamic B-MISC
thoughts O
. O

Besides O
, O
it O
is O
shameful O
and O
wrong O
to O
describe O
an O
Islamic B-MISC
movement O
as O
an O
empty O
cart O
causing O
noise O
, O
or O
to O
say O
that O
its O
mind O
is O
so O
narrow O
that O
its O
tongue O
expanded O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
bigger O
than O
this O
. O

That O
is O
why O
we O
have O
a O
right O
to O
ask O
: O
Why O
then O
did O
the O
minds O
of O
those O
people O
go O
astray O
? O

Here O
I O
do O
not O
favor O
one O
movement O
over O
another O
, O
rather O
I O
describe O
reality O
, O
and O
bring O
it O
to O
our O
collective O
memory O
, O
so O
it O
can O
be O
a O
witness O
against O
those O
people O
. O

The O
truth O
, O
which O
we O
should O
not O
ignore O
, O
and O
which O
answers O
that O
question O
, O
indicates O
that O
their O
ambition O
goes O
beyond O
denying O
the O
reprehensible O
, O
having O
correct O
beliefs O
, O
and O
preaching O
the O
only O
sect O
- O
it O
goes O
much O
beyond O
that O
. O

In O
short O
, O
their O
goal O
is O
the O
seat O
of O
power O
, O
to O
which O
they O
want O
to O
appoint O
their O
caliph B-MISC
someday O
. O

In O
short O
, O
their O
goal O
is O
to O
return O
to O
the O
Islamic B-MISC
caliphate O
, O
which O
is O
their O
dearest O
and O
most O
precious O
wish O
. O

That O
means O
, O
in O
any O
case O
, O
the O
destruction O
of O
Al B-MISC
Saud I-MISC
dynasty O
as O
a O
start O
, O
then O
electing O

the O

The O
Western B-MISC
man O
, O
when O
he O
sits O
and O
listens O
to O
news O
reports O
or O
political O
or O
controversial O
speeches O
, O
he O
submits O
the O
information O
to O
his O
mental O
kitchen O
or O
what O
is O
called O
feedback O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
draw O
out O
the O
essence O
and O
truth O
from O
it O
and O
to O
relegate O
embellishments O
to O
oblivion O
, O
or O
ignorance O
and O
ridicule O
, O

These O
are O
catchphrase O
lies O
or O
, O
if O
we O
want O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
the O
mental O
demeaning O
of O
the O
intellect O
of O
the O
listener O
or O
recipient O
of O
the O
information O
. O

This O
is O
what O
differentiates O
the O
western B-MISC
man O
from O
the O
eastern B-MISC
man O
who O
has O
gotten O
used O
to O
not O
exerting O
his O
mind O
and O
using O
his O
mind O
with O
analysis O
and O
critique O
. O

Given O
that O
he O
lives O
in O
a O
consumer O
society O
, O
he O
has O
no O
productive O
capacity O
left O
, O

why O
would O
he O
use O
the O
productive O
capacity O
bestowed O
on O
him O
by O
God B-PER
? O

And O
indeed O
he O
does O
not O
possess O
any O
production O
incentives O
. O

He O
carries O
what O
he O
is O
programmed O
to O
memorize O
and O
he O
repeats O
, O
and O
on O
many O
occasions O
he O
does O
not O
understand O
. O

This O
is O
the O
paradox O
between O
a O
productive O
society O
exemplified O
by O
the O
West B-MISC
and O
the O
consumer O
society O
represented O
by O
the O
East B-MISC
. O

And O
this O
is O
what O
has O
led O
both O
enemies O
and O
friends O
to O
call O
on O
psychologists O
and O
philosophers O
to O
formulate O
the O
slogan O
so O
that O
it O
is O
compatible O
with O
emotion O
and O
possesses O
the O
power O
to O
pierce O
the O
heart O
without O
exhausting O
the O
mind O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
, O
we O
have O
reached O
the O
state O
in O
which O
we O
now O
live O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
stagnation O
, O
bearing O
its O
load O
. O




The O
Muslims B-MISC
in O
their O
early O
history O
did O
not O
designate O
a O
day O
to O
lay O
work O
aside O
. O

This O
is O
why O
some O
scholars O
considered O
taking O
Friday B-MISC
off O
a O
kind O
of O
imitation O
of O
the O
unbelievers O
, O
because O
they O
are O
accustomed O
to O
leaving O
work O
on O
their O
weekly O
holiday O
, O
like O
Saturday B-MISC
for O
Jews B-MISC
and O
Sunday B-MISC
for O
Christians B-MISC
. O

It O
has O
become O
common O
in O
the O
Islamic B-MISC
world O
to O
take O
off O
from O
official O
and O
semi-official O
work O
, O
such O
as O
in O
companies O
, O
on O
Friday B-MISC
. O

The O
excuse O
for O
taking O
off O
on O
Friday B-MISC
was O
that O
one O
would O
be O
free O
for O
Friday B-MISC
prayers O
. O

That O
is O
why O
it O
has O
become O
an O
acceptable O
custom O
, O
and O
this O
distances O
it O
from O
the O
comparison O
that O
Friday B-MISC
is O
the O
Muslims B-MISC
' O
weekly B-MISC
holiday O
. O

God B-PER
guided O
this O
community O
to O
this O
day O
and O
led O
it O
away O
from O
Jews B-MISC
and O
Christians B-MISC
. O

Jews B-MISC
have O
Saturday B-MISC
, O
and O
Christians B-MISC
have O
Sunday B-MISC
. O

But O
when O
the O
imitation O
sickness O
intensified O
in O
the O
Islamic B-MISC
community O
, O
their O
ways O
of O
taking O
on O
the O
attitudes O
of O
unbelieving O
people O
diversified O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
made O
the O
weekend O
Saturday B-MISC
and O
Sunday B-MISC
, O
like O
Jewish B-MISC
and O
Christian B-MISC
countries O
. O

This O
is O
the O
ugliest O
type O
of O
imitation O
in O
this O
matter O
. O

And O
some O
of O
them O
made O
the O
weekend O
Friday B-MISC
and O
Saturday B-MISC
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
anyone O
made O
the O
weekend O
three O
days O
. O

And O
some O
of O
them O
were O
satisfied O
to O
imitate O
the O
number O
of O
days O
of O
the O
weekend O
, O
so O
they O
made O
the O
week O
's O
holiday O
on O
Thursday B-MISC
and O
Friday B-MISC
. O

This O
is O
the O
lesser O
evil O
among O
them O
. O

There O
are O
many O
evils O
in O
long O
holidays O
; O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
detailing O
them O
, O
and O
God B-PER
knows O
better O
. O

Peace O
be O
upon O
our O
Prophet O
Mohamed B-PER

the O

again O

the O
story O
of O
Hua O
Xin O
and O
Wang O
Lang O
in O
the O
New O
Anecdotes O
of O
Social O
Talk O
. O

[jingzhe19] O
The O
two O
guys O
was O
fleeing O
for O
life O
in O
a O
carriage O
, O
when O
they O
met O
a O
hitch O

on O
their O
way O

[jingzhe19] O
Hua O
Xin O
was O
hesitant O

reluctant O

Wang O
Lang O
said O
it O
was O
fine O
to O
carry O
him O
as O
there O
is O
still O
a O
seat O
on O
the O
carriage O
. O

[jingzhe19] O
So O
he O
let O
him O
on O
. O

[jingzhe19] O
After O
the O
guy O
got O
on O
, O
the O
carriage O
was O
chased O
by O
bandits O

Wang O
Lang O
was O
scared O

wanted O
to O
drop O
the O
guy O
to O
reduce O
the O
load O
of O
the O
carriage O

[jingzhe19] O
Hua O
Xin O
said O
the O
reason O
why O
I O

him O

earlier O
was O
that O
I O
was O

A B-MISC
few I-MISC
days I-MISC
ago I-MISC
, O
another O
Taiwanese B-MISC
star O
passed O
away O
. O

I O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
her O
. O

I O
hear O
she O
was O
a O
talented O
beauty O
. O

What O
a O
great O
pity O
! O

The O
accident O
was O
a O
car O
crash O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
entertainment O
news O
denounced O
that O
+her O
car O
's O
front O
airbag O
failed O
to O
release O
, O
which O
caused O
the O
death O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the B-MISC
MINI I-MISC
COOPER I-MISC
she O
was O
riding O
in O
is O
not O
what O
the O
reports O
said O
. O

It O
is O
the O
car O
with O
the O
highest O
safety O
index O
. O

It O
is O
sold O
for O
190,000 B-MISC
HK I-MISC
dollars I-MISC
in O
Hong B-LOC
Kong I-LOC
. O

Polo B-MISC
also O
sells O
for O
more O
than O
140,000 B-MISC
HK I-MISC
dollars I-MISC
. O

It O
's O
just O
a O
cute O
little O
car O
, O
preferred O
by O
girls O
. O

But O
safety O
is O
surely O
not O
too O
big O
of O
a O
problem O
. O

The O
collision O
happened O
on O
the O
side O
and O
rear O
. O

So O
, O
the O
side O
airbag O
and O
air O
curtain O
were O
fully O
opened O
. O

They O
opened O
at O
the O
time O
of O
first B-MISC
collision O
with O
the O
protective O
fence O
. O

The O
first B-MISC
collision O
was O
with O
the O
protective O
fence O
only O
, O
and O
the O
impact O
on O
the O
people O
was O
very O
small O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
was O
the O
protection O
of O
the O
air O
curtain O
. O

So O
, O
there O
would O
surely O
not O
be O
a O
big O
problem O
. O

The O
real O
fatal O
collision O
was O
the O
second B-MISC
one O
from O
the O
tailgating O
truck O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
all O
the O
airbags O
were O
already O
deflated O
. O

There O
was O
no O
protective O
effect O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
force O
of O
this O
one O
was O
extremely O
large O
. O

If O
the O
car O
had O
been O
stopped O
at O
an O
angle O
, O
then O
the O
head O
of O
the O
person O
sitting O
on O
one O
side O
would O
surely O
have O
hit O
the O
glass O
or O
the O
B O
column O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
there O
would O
not O
have O
been O
too O
much O
of O
a O
problem O
for O
someone O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

This O
is O
common O
knowledge O
. O

Then O
it O
came O
down O
to O
who O
had O
the O
bad O
luck O
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
car O
that O
was O
angled O
out O
. O

It O
was O
perfectly O
correct O
for O
the O
front O
airbag O
not O
to O
open O
, O
because O
the O
front O
of O
the O
car O
was O
not O
damaged O
at O
all O
. O

None O
of O
the O
sensors O
received O
any O
signal O
of O
a O
collision O
. O

Just O
imagine O
, O
this O
was O
a O
rear O
collision O
. O

The O
people O
went O
backward O
abruptly O
. O

Their O
bodies O
could O
have O
been O
supported O
by O
the O
seats O
, O
but O
the O
impact O
on O
their O
necks O
and O
heads O
was O
tremendous O
. O

When O
they O
went O
abruptly O
backward O
, O
any O
additional O
misfortune O
of O
the O
front O
airbag O
opening O
for O
no O
reason O
would O
have O
eliminated O
any O
chance O
of O
survival O
. O

So O
, O
of O
all O
the O
cars O
in O
the O
world O
, O
even O
a O
Rolls B-MISC
- I-MISC
Royce I-MISC
, O
the O
front O
airbag O
will O
not O
open O
during O
a O
rear O
collision O
. O

If O
the O
front O
airbag O
opened O
after O
being O
tailgated O
, O
that O
would O
be O
a O
quality O
problem O
, O
and O
would O
be O
extremely O
dangerous O
. O

The O
safety O
airbag O
's O
eruption O
could O
knock O
someone O
to O
death O
. O

So O
, O
infants O
are O
strictly O
forbidden O
from O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
seat O
. O

That O
was O
how O
the O
whole O
accident O
took O
place O
. O

The O
result O
of O
the O
accident O
investigation O
division O
will O
not O
be O
different O
from O
this O
. O

For O
this O
kind O
of O
accident O
, O
conclusions O
can O
be O
drawn O
from O
a O
single O
glance O
at O
the O
car O
wreckage O
. O

The O
car O
and O
the O
car O
manufacturer O
have O
no O
fault O
. O

All O
of O
the O
car O
's O
passive O
safety O
protections O
had O
already O
fully O
carried O
out O
their O
functions O
. O

So O
, O
it O
is O
extremely O
ridiculous O
and O
unscientific O
to O
blame O
and O
suspect O
the O
car O
and O
the O
car O
manufacturer O
for O
such O
an O
accident O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
speculation O
about O
why O
the O
front O
airbags O
did O
not O
open O
was O
very O
amateurish O
. O

Only O
by O
not O
opening O
would O
it O
have O
been O
correct O
. O

If O
they O
had O
opened O
, O
her O
assistant O
might O
still O
be O
lying O
in O
the O
hospital O
. O

If O
an O
accident O
occurs O
on O
the O
freeway O
, O
please O
get O
out O
of O
the O
car O
and O
leave O
immediately O
if O
you O
can O
move O
. O

Many O
freeway O
accidents O
occur O
simply O
because O
people O
stay O
inside O
the O
car O
and O
sort O
out O
their O
thoughts O
, O
following O
which O
there O
is O
a O
fatal O
crash O
from O
a O
car O
following O
behind O
. O

About O
death O
, O
I O
have O
always O
believed O
that O
they O
do O
not O
leave O
the O
world O
. O

They O
only O
leave O
the O
human O
world O
. O

They O
are O
surely O
sharing O
the O
same O
world O
with O
us O
, O
with O
a O
different O
manifestation O
of O
life O
. O

Guo B-PER
Kai I-PER

Economic I-PER
Notes I-PER

This O
morning O
I O
went O
to O
the O
supermarket O
with O
Dad O
, O
and O
when O
it O
came O
time O
to O
check O
out O
I O
discovered O
something O
that O
everybody O
probably O
knows O
: O
not O
everybody O
buys O
the O
same O
things O
. O

Of O
course O
this O
is O
a O
no O
- O
brainer O
, O
but O
this O
is O
actually O
a O
major O
problem O
faced O
by O
me O
and O
many O
other O
people O
whenever O
we O
discuss O
economic O
issues O
or O
economic O
phenomena O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
economic O
policy O
and O
economic O
theory O
are O
not O
aimed O
at O
individuals O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
probability O
, O
if O
you O
explain O
the O
behavior O
of O
a O
specific O
individual O
, O
for O
example O
your O
uncle O
, O
using O
any O
economic O
theory O
, O
the O
probability O
that O
it O
will O
be O
accurate O
is O
virtually O
0 B-MISC
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
the O
great O
majority O
of O
cases O
the O
economic O
theory O
is O
aimed O
at O
an O
entire O
group O
, O
or O
a O
subgroup O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
averages O
, O
accuracy O
is O
the O
goal O
of O
many O
economic O
theories O
-LRB- O
here O
I O
'm O
being O
inaccurate O
; O
I O
hope O
the O
experts O
will O
not O
take O
it O
too O
literally O
, O
especially O
those O
with O
IO O
expertise O
-RRB- O
. O

But O
with O
regard O
to O
an O
ordinary O
person O
, O
he O
may O
never O
see O
the O
whole O
group O
, O
he O
sees O
only O
his O
co-workers O
, O
his O
relatives O
and O
his O
friends O
, O
the O
group O
of O
people O
familiar O
to O
him O
; O
add O
up O
all O
the O
people O
in O
this O
group O
and O
they O
may O
number O
200 B-MISC
, O
and O
that O
is O
already O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
. O

Below O
I O
am O
going O
to O
refer O
to O
these O
200 B-MISC
people O
collectively O
as O
" O
his O
uncle O
. O
" O

So O
whenever O
you O
discuss O
an O
economic O
theory O
with O
someone O
, O
the O
response O
of O
a O
perfectly O
ordinary O
person O
would O
be O
: O
My O
uncle O
is O
n't O
like O
that O
, O
so O
this O
theory O
is O
baloney O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
everybody O
tends O
to O
mistake O
the O
part O
for O
the O
whole O
. O

Here O
, O
mistaking O
the O
part O
for O
the O
whole O
is O
not O
derogatory O
; O
it O
is O
a O
limitation O
of O
the O
human O
race O
itself O
; O
you O
have O
it O
and O
I O
have O
it O
. O

If O
Americans B-MISC
had O
learned O
not O
to O
mistake O
the O
part O
for O
the O
whole O
, O
they O
might O
not O
have O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
of O
the O
world O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
they O
made O
such O
a O
complete O
mess O
of O
the B-MISC
Middle I-MISC
East I-MISC
to O
a O
very O
large O
extent O
because O
they O
applied O
their O
own O
common O
sense O
to O
understanding O
the B-MISC
Middle I-MISC
East I-MISC
, O
which O
is O
a O
completely O
different O
place O
from O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

On O
this O
issue O
, O
China B-LOC
does O
not O
have O
much O
basis O
for O
being O
self O
- O
congratulatory O
; O
China B-LOC
's O
rapid O
rise O
has O
even O
caused O
some O
people O
to O
have O
a O
sort O
of O
misconception O
- O
that O
whatever O
China B-LOC
does O
is O
right O
- O
and O
this O
is O
in O
fact O
a O
manifestation O
of O
narrow O
- O
mindedness O
. O

Therefore O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
extremely O
important O
to O
recognize O
that O
one O
's O
own O
knowledge O
has O
limitations O
. O

We O
need O
to O
maintain O
a O
sufficiently O
open O
attitude O
toward O
things O
that O
do O
n't O
correspond O
to O
our O
common O
sense O
. O

So O
just O
because O
every O
time O
your O
uncle O
goes O
to O
the O
supermarket O
he O
buys O
hog O
head O
meat O
does O
n't O
mean O
that O
we O
should O
immediately O
assume O
that O
any O
theory O
that O
does O
not O
predict O
people O
going O
to O
the O
supermarket O
will O
buy O
hog O
head O
meat O
is O
wrong O
. O

When O
you O
feel O
other O
people O
are O
talking O
baloney O
, O
and O
what O
other O
people O
say O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
your O
" O
common O
sense O
, O
" O
you O
should O
at O
the O
same O
time O
recognize O
that O
your O
uncle O
is O
only O
your O
uncle O
, O
he O
is O
not O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

revolution O
could O
be O
said O
a O
rudimentary O
one O
, O
which O
made O
me O
decide O
eventually O
to O
eliminate O
all O
the O
betrayers O
and O
heretics O
in O
one O
action O
!. O

The O
incident O
was O
caused O
by O
a O
molar O
. O

The O
location O
of O
the O
tooth O
was O
just O
next O
to O
the O
broken O
wisdom O
tooth O
that O
led O
to O
my O
first B-MISC
visit O
to O
an O
American B-MISC
dentist O
. O

For O
some O
unknown O
reason O
, O
when O
I O
was O
eating O
the O
other O
day O
, O
the O
tooth O
suddenly O
ached O
during O
the O
meal O
, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
painful O
. O

Unexpected O
I O
heard O
a O
" O
crack O
" O
while O
I O
was O
eating O
, O
and O
part O
of O
the O
tooth O
fell O
off O
!. O

I O
could O
not O
remember O
eating O
anything O
hard O
?!. O

I O
rushed O
to O
the O
dentist O
, O
who O
said O
root O
canal O
therapy O
upon O
seeing O
it O
, O
your O
dental O
nerve O
had O
come O
out O
!. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
root O
canal O
meant O
but O
thought O
the O
name O
was O
quite O
fancy O
. O

It O
was O
after O
I O
began O
to O
receive O
it O
that O
I O
found O
it O
really O
painful O
!. O

For O
example O
killing O
the O
nerves O
, O
and O
dealing O
with O
the O
dental O
crown O
... O

I O
asked O
the O
dentist O
then O
why O
my O
tooth O
broke O
. O

After O
examining O
my O
25 B-MISC
teeth O
, O
the O
dentist O
told O
me O
seriously O
that O
the O
teeth O
on O
the O
right O
side O
were O
somewhat O
" O
cross O
biting O
" O
due O
to O
the O
" O
parallel O
shift O
" O
of O
my O
teeth O
, O
such O
that O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
right O
teeth O
were O
always O
against O
each O
other O
. O

The O
wrong O
position O
had O
led O
to O
uneven O
abrasions O
, O
resulting O
in O
the O
broken O
tooth O
. O

I O
asked O
what O
solutions O
are O
available O
? O

The O
dentist O
said O
" O
correction O
. O
" O

Thus O
, O
three B-MISC
years I-MISC
after O
I O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
" O
brigand O
orthodontist O
, O
" O
I O
stepped O
into O
the O
orthodontist O
's O
office O
again O
... O

-- O

Hard O
work O
without O
talent O
is O
a O
shame O
, O
but O
talent O
without O
hardwork O
is O
a O
tragedy O
! O

are O
you O
a O

While O
Qingqing B-PER
was O
rinsing O
her O

for O
the O
second B-MISC
time O
last B-MISC
night I-MISC
, O
mom O
said O
: O
leaks O
air O
and O
leaks O
rain O
. O

Qingqing B-PER
was O
unhappy O
upon O
hearing O
that O
. O

She O
pounded O
mom O
with O
her O
little O
fists O
. O

Dad O
also O
scolded O
mom O
: O
you O
also O
leaked O
air O
and O
leaked O
rain O
while O
your O
permanent O
teeth O
grew O
in O
your O
childhood O
. O

Qingqing B-PER
looked O
at O
Mom O
with O
water O
in O
the O
mouth O
. O

At O
last O
, O
she O
said O
to O
mom O
after O
spitting O
it O
into O
the O
basin O
: O
I O
meant O
to O
spew O
it O
on O
your O
head O
. O

Dad O
praised O
Qingqing B-PER
for O
being O
thoughtful O
: O
knowing O
what O
she O
should O
do O
. O

Qingqing B-PER
played O
in O
bed O
after O
waking O
up O
in O
the B-MISC
morning I-MISC
. O

Dad O
yelled O
, O
but O
she O
would O
n't O
get O
up O
and O
wanted O
to O
play O
a O
little O
longer O
. O

Dad O
looked O
at O
Qingqing B-PER
and O
teased O
Qingqing B-PER
: O
how O
come O
this O
kid O
opens O
her O
eyes O
while O
sleeping O
? O

How O
come O
this O
kid O
sounds O
like O
" O
enen O
" O
while O
snoring O
? O

Qingqing B-PER
told O
dad O
: O
I O
am O
just O
teasing O
you O
. O

After O
she O
got O
up O
and O
dressed O
, O
she O
would O
n't O
eat O
the O
red O
bean O
buns O
or O
red O
sticky O
rice O
congee O
prepared O
by O
dad O
. O

Instead O
she O
asked O
for O
soaked O
biscuits O
and O
did O
drawings O
in O
the O
room O
after O
finishing O
. O

After O
a O
simple O
lunch O
, O
Qingqing B-PER
wanted O
to O
buy O
stickers O
at O
Jinsheng B-MISC
. O

She O
bumped O
into O
grandma O
on O
her O
way O
and O
also O
saw O
a O
lost O
dog O
advertisement O
on O
a O
wire O
pole O
. O

Dad O
read O
to O
Qingqing B-PER
, O
and O
then O
we O
arrived O
at O
Jinrunfa B-MISC
by O
shuttle O
bus O
, O
but O
could O
n't O
find O
the O
stickers O
that O
Qingqing B-PER
wanted O
. O

We O
then O
went O
to O
Jinsheng B-MISC
, O
where O
we O
finally O
found O
them O
. O

Dad O
bought O
four B-MISC
volumes O
: O
. O

One B-MISC
for O
each O
of O
her O
two B-MISC
sisters O
. O

One B-MISC
to O
be O
placed O
at O
Qingqing O

home O
and O
one B-MISC

her O

Qingqing B-PER
arranged O
everything O
very O
well O
. O

We O
got O
on O
the O
bus O
to O
dine O
out O
. O

Mom B-PER
asked O
Qingqing B-PER
to O
make O
a O
choice O
: O
is O
the O
back O
of O
the O
bus O
empty O
or O
full O

Qingqing B-PER
first O
chose O
" O
full O
. O
" O

When O
it O
was O
almost O
there O
, O
Mom B-PER
asked O
Qingqing B-PER
to O
choose O
again O
, O
and O
Qingqing B-PER
chose O
" O
empty O
. O
" O

Qingqing B-PER
said O
after O
getting O
off O
: O
I O
won O
. O

Mom B-PER
said O
: O
I O
intentionally O
let O
you O
win O
, O
otherwise O
you O
will O
lose O
. O

Qingqing B-PER
wanted O
to O
pee O
on O
the O
way O
, O
dad B-PER
had O
to O
hold O
Qingqing B-PER
to O
pee O
by O
the O
tree O
. O

It O
was O
very O
cold O
, O
and O
dad B-PER
tidied O
Qingqing B-PER
's O
pants O
quickly O
. O

Qingqing B-PER
wanted O
to O
play O
with O
the O
sticker O
after O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
hotel O
. O

Dad B-PER
discussed O
conditions O
with O
Qingqing B-PER
: O
dad B-PER
will O
let O
you O
play O
if O
you O
eat O
well O
. O

Qingqing B-PER
agreed O
and O
began O
to O
play O
again O
. O

Mom B-PER
said O
she O
wanted O
to O
swap O
to O
another O
place O
, O
but O
dad B-PER
wanted O
to O
let O
Qingqing B-PER
stay O
longer O
in O
the O
sun O
. O

Qingqing B-PER
was O
so O
obsessed O
with O
playing O
that O
she O
would O
n't O
have O
dinner O
. O

Dad B-PER
had O
to O
put O
away O
Qingqing B-PER
's O
sticker O
book O
and O
asked O
Qingqing B-PER
to O
eat O
well O
. O

Qingqing B-PER
said O
it O
was O
spicy O
and O
she O
would O
n't O
eat O
. O

Mom B-PER
promised O
to O
buy O
Qingqing B-PER
white O
fungus O
broth O
later O
. O

Qingqing B-PER
became O
happy O
immediately O
and O
played O
on O
. O

We O
walked O
home O
after O
eating O
, O
and O
Qingqing B-PER
played O
in O
her O
own O
room O
after O
dinner O
. O

Dad B-PER
said O
it O
was O
time O
to O
sleep O
, O
but O
she O
would O
n't O
sleep O
until O
after O
she O
played O
for O
a O
while O
in O
bed O
. O

She O
told O
dad B-PER
that O
she O
wanted O
to O
take O
one B-MISC
book O
to O
the O
kindergarten O
. O

Qingqing B-PER
said O
today O
: O
the O
teacher O
said O
last O
time O
that O
she O
would O
repay O
the O
money O
she O
borrowed O
from O
me O
the B-MISC
next I-MISC
day I-MISC
, O
but O
she O
has O
not O

. O

Oh O
! O
Grown O
- O
ups O
would O
n't O
live O
up O

Dad B-PER
promised O
to O
remind O
the O
teacher O
for O
Qingqing B-PER

I O
wish O
you O
all O
knew O
how O
good O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
to O
break O
bread O
and O
hoist O
a O
toast O
with O
you O
; O
especially O
after O
having O
survived O
situations O
where O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
know O
if O
I O
was O
going O
to O
survive O
through O
the O
next O
five O
minutes O
. O




do O
you O
have O
to O
lassoo O
it O
before O
you O
can O
hitch O
it O
up O
? O




It O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
how O
Cingular O
is O
going O
to O
hobble O
that O
up O
to O
force O
you O
to O
use O
their O
$ O
network O
$ O
. O




It O
's O
a O
wonder O
you O
can O
hobble O
around O
USENET O
. O




They O
had O
to O
hitch O
a O
ride O
with O
another O
San O
Diego O
couple O
who O
took O
them O
directly O
to O
the O
border O
. O




A O
set O
of O
bills O
in O
the O
House O
and O
Senate O
would O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
grant O
USPS O
greater O
flexibility O
to O
hitch O
its O
rate O
increases O
to O
inflation O
. O




We O
can O
save O
her O
life O
if O
she O
hitches O
a O
ride O
from O
TN O
to O
CT O
with O
Scooby O
! O




I O
could O
n't O
do O
that O
again O
, O
so O
I O
hoisted O
what O
was O
left O
of O
the O
antenna O
up O
to O
the O
top O
of O
my O
35-foot O
tower O
, O
and O
trimmed O
the O
legs O
so O
that O
they O
would O
stay O
within O
the O
property O
line O
. O




If O
one O
had O
good O
rapport O
with O
the O
coalsawdust O
, O
bread O
, O
or O
milk O
delivery O
truck O
driver O
, O
one O
could O
hitch O
up O
to O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
truck O
and O
be O
recognizable O
in O
their O
outside O
mirror O
, O
and O
get O
a O
boost O
back O
to O
school O
after O
lunch O
if O
running O
late O
-- O
as O
long O
as O
we O
did O
n't O
overly O
exploit O
the O
favour O
, O
or O
act O
goofy O
while O
doing O
so O
. O




It O
would O
be O
easier O
for O
them O
to O
hobble O
to O
town O
with O
a O
broken O
leg O
than O
with O
a O
broken O
pantaloon O
. O

So O
, O
I O
have O
a O
decision O
to O
make O
- O
as O
I O
said O
: O
& O
quot O
; O
it O
's O
either O

will O
nicely O
shade O

I O
thought O

first O

I O
did O
it O

he O
glided O
down O

it O
was O

saw O
what O

do O
when O
it O

I O
thought O

By O
the O
way O
, O
one O
of O
the O
main O
issues O

was O
the O
need O
for O

normalize O

, O
the O
importance O
of O

recognized O
not O
as O
a O

which O
must O
begin O
right O
now. O

In O
fact O
, O
these O

are O
specifically O
designed O
to O
nurture O

Part O
of O
the O
reason O
the O
glossary O
exists O
is O
not O
just O
to O
modularize O
the O
terminology O
of O
the O
language O
, O
but O
also O
to O
normalize O
the O
vocabulary O
among O
Lisp O
practitioners O

We O
were O
created O
to O
nurture O
the O
world O
. O




It O
's O
hard O
to O
describe O
how O
many O
ways O
it O
reeks O
. O




The O
voters O
recoiled O
but O
it O
does O
not O
as O
yet O
make O
her O
history O
. O




Now O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
government O
should O
get O
involved O
as O
part O
of O
Consumer O
Protection O
is O
a O
different O
argument O
, O
but O
it O
's O
plain O
that O
the O
airline O
companies O
royally O
reamed O
their O
customers O
. O




I O
did O
the O

so O
at O
the O
moment O
I O
reek O
of O

Now O
they O
are O
back O
, O
inviting O
all O
their O
friends O
and O
family O
to O
share O
as O
they O
recommit O
themselves O
to O
each O
other O

And O
not O
too O
happy O
about O
the O
people O
who O
used O

be O
on O

in O

Morning O
and O
then O
recoiled O

The O
whole O
situation O
reeks O

For O
example O
, O
Gomer O
might O
try O
to O
hug O
the O

So O
, O
to O
me O
, O
this O
episode O
absolutely O
reeks O
of O
the O
theme O
. O




As O
far O
as O
the O
recline O
is O
concerned O
- O
you O
can O
recline O

Indeed O
it O
is O
nonsensical O
because O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
or O
need O
to O
posit O
the O
existence O
of O
an O
uncreated O
first O

because O
it O
is O
not O
known O
that O
one O
is O
necessary O
to O
explain O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
universe O
and O
there O
are O
no O
other O
observations O
that O

support O
of O

posit O

willing O
to O
take O

that O
is O

maybe O
they O
could O
do O
that O
if O

Zhou O

He O
lost O
his O

was O

Do O

have O
a O

value O

Do O

These O
are O
already O
elements O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
a O
socialist O
country O
one O
can O
not O
act O
in O
that O
way O
. O

In O
the O
area O
of O
profiting O
from O
commodities O
, O
there O
have O
been O
no O
systems O
in O
place O
and O
no O
legal O
provisions O
ever O
since O
the O
reforms O
, O
there O
is O
no O
last O
word O
on O
how O
many O
multiples O
of O
cost O
profits O
are O
allowed O
to O
be O
, O
or O
what O
percentage O
. O

China O
's O
self O
- O
sufficient O
, O
natural O
economy O
was O
not O
without O
any O
advantages O
. O

At O
least O
it O
did O
n't O
try O
to O
reap O
large O
profits O
off O
its O
own O
people O
, O
now O
the O
exact O
opposite O
is O
the O
case O
. O

A O
home O
appliance O
- O
whether O
you O
are O
Chinese O
or O
a O
foreigner O
, O
which O
regional O
category O
you O
fit O
in O
, O
whether O
you O
are O
a O
big O
city O
or O
a O
small O
city O
, O
whether O
you O
are O
a O
worker O
or O
a O
peasant O
- O
is O
always O
the O
same O
price O
. O

Not O
knowing O
how O
much O
profit O
is O
in O
there O
, O
not O
caring O
who O
can O
afford O
it O
and O
who O
ca O
n't O
, O
these O
do O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
the O
principles O
of O
socialism O
. O

And O
with O
farmers O
' O
grain O
and O
rural O
products O
, O
if O
the O
country O
does O
n't O
wipe O
out O
agricultural O
taxes O
and O
does O
n't O
offer O
any O
subsidies O
, O
keeping O
on O
producing O
is O
a O
problem O
. O

In O
order O
to O
improve O
the O
people O
's O
living O
standards O
, O
the O
government O
-LRB- O
set O
things O
so O
that O
-RRB- O
grain O
is O
always O
the O
same O
price O
whether O
sold O
to O
big O
cities O
or O
to O
rich O
people O
. O

With O
this O
kind O
of O
ratio O
in O
existence O
, O
in O
struggling O
areas O
trying O
for O
a O
comfortable O
life O
is O
very O
difficult O
. O

This O
issue O
should O
attract O
the O
close O
attention O
of O
economists O
. O




This O
type O
of O
exploitation O
can O
only O
push O
them O
further O
into O
destitution O
and O
will O
make O
their O
lives O
more O
difficult O
in O
the O
future O
. O

They O
made O
donations O
, O
and O
society O
accepted O
their O
donations O
. O

Supposing O
they O
experience O
hardships O
later O
in O
their O
lives O
, O
or O
if O
they O
fall O
ill O
, O
who O
will O
give O
donations O
for O
them O
or O
look O
after O
them O
? O

If O
our O
country O
had O
set O
up O
a O
mechanism O
to O
provide O
social O
security O
to O
the O
people O
in O
terms O
of O
livelihood O
, O
pensions O
, O
medical O
care O
, O
clothing O
and O
food O
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
acceptable O
to O
take O
such O
donations O
of O
the O
poor O
, O
but O
have O
we O
set O
one O
up O
? O

What O
rationale O
is O
there O
in O
our O
not O
dealing O
with O
the O
extravagance O
and O
corruption O
of O
the O
bureaucrats O
, O
but O
actually O
accepting O
the O
donations O
of O
the O
poor O
? O

" O
One O
meal O
for O
the O
bureaucrats O
is O
a O
year O
's O
worth O
of O
grain O
to O
the O
poor O
, O
" O
and O
even O
several O
years O
' O
worth O
. O

There O
can O
be O
no O
justification O
for O
us O
to O
ask O
the O
poor O
for O
donations O
. O

The O
ordinary O
people O
simply O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
our O
bureaucrats O
, O
while O
they O
consume O
a O
year O
's O
grain O
for O
a O
poor O
person O
at O
one O
meal O
, O
can O
eat O
it O
calmly O
, O
and O
can O
swallow O
it O
. O

You O
could O
say O
that O
the O
=top O
social O
strata O
have O
been O
generous O
to O
foreigners O
and O
to O
foreign O
capital O
during O
the O
reform O
and O
opening O
- O
up O
. O

In O
order O
to O
draw O
in O
foreign O
capital O
, O
we O
have O
given O
the O
foreigners O
an O
array O
of O
all O
sorts O
of O
dazzling O
preferential O
policies O
, O
whether O
they O
could O
be O
given O
or O
not O
, O
and O
also O
gave O
the O
foreigners O
far O
too O
much O
better O
treatment O
over O
our O
countrymen O
, O
allowing O
the O
foreigners O
to O
make O
money O
hand O
over O
fist O
during O
China O
's O
reform O
and O
opening O
- O

Records O
indicate O
that O
Mother O
Nature O
has O
meted O
out O
punishment O
to O
humankind O
on O
a O
total O
of O
three O
occasions O
during O
the O
last O
one O
- O
hundred O
years O
. O

Two O
of O
these O
instances O
were O
in O
China O
. O

One O
instance O
was O
the O
great O
flood O
of O
1931 O
, O
in O
which O
in O
excess O
of O
3.5 O
million O
people O
died O
in O
China O
. O

The O
second O
instance O
was O
the O
1976 O
Tangshan O
Earthquake O
, O
where O
over O
250 O
thousand O
died O
. O

More O
than O
120 O
thousand O
people O
died O
in O
this O
current O
tsunami O
. O

Although O
there O
is O
a O
diminishing O
trend O
to O
the O
number O
of O
casualties O
in O
these O
three O
disasters O
, O
the O
figure O
of O
120 O
thousand O
is O
nonetheless O
alarming O
indeed O
. O

Where O
the O
beaches O
of O
these O
countries O
were O
littered O
with O
human O
bodies O
, O
surprisingly O
there O
were O
no O
wild O
animal O
corpses O
to O
be O
found O
. O

Some O
animals O
, O
including O
elephants O
, O
during O
the O
preceding O
few O
days O
had O
already O
taken O
to O
their O
heels O
and O
headed O
for O
the O
mountains O
. O

And O
only O
after O
the O
tsunami O
was O
over O
did O
they O
come O
down O
to O
search O
for O
water O
. O

Is O
this O
an O
accident O
? O

Run O

tells O

it O
is O
n't O

However O
, O
damage O
to O

in O
the O

was O
not O

serious O

In O
the O
days O
leading O
up O

the O
Tangshan O
earthquake O
, O
horses O
, O
cows O

did O

even O

were O
a O

When O

said O

I O

it O
here O
by O

from O

Like O
the O
Great O
Tangshan O
Earthquake O
, O
the O
earthquake O
in O
Wenchuan O
, O
Sichuan O
, O
this O
time O
has O
rendered O
people O
as O
helpless O
as O
ants O
and O
caused O
enormous O
loss O
of O
human O
lives O
and O
property O
. O

However O
, O
one O
issue O
not O
to O
be O
ignored O
is O
that O
loss O
is O
=particularly O
concentrated O
at O
schools O
and O
student O
casualties O
are O
=particularly O
heavy O
, O
which O
has O
become O
the O
biggest O
highlight O
of O
the O
earthquake O
. O

The O
great O
earthquake O
of O
magnitude O
7.8 O
has O
revealed O
the O
" O
jerry O
- O
built O
project O
" O
nature O
of O
school O
buildings O
. O

We O
should O
say O
although O
the O
great O
earthquake O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
resisted O
, O
the O
" O
jerry O
- O
built O
projects O
" O
have O
further O
stabbed O
the O
wounds O
of O
the O
disaster O
victims O
, O
becoming O
another O
killer O
of O
the O
nation O
's O
future O
blossoms O
. O

Why O
has O
the O
strong O
earthquake O
disaster O
revealed O
the O
" O
jerry O
- O
built O
" O
phenomenon O
in O
our O
school O
building O
projects O
? O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
the O
country O
has O
invested O
heavily O
in O
education O
, O
especially O
in O
its O
effort O
to O
develop O
school O
buildings O
. O

The O
slogan O
" O
the O
best O
buildings O
are O
schools O
" O
has O
also O
become O
the O
common O
understanding O
of O
local O
governments O
and O
competent O
education O
authorities O
. O

People O
of O
all O
social O
circles O
have O
also O
contributed O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
and O
energy O
to O
the O
" O
Hope O
Project O
. O
" O

Yet O
how O
come O
we O
have O
so O
few O
best O

? O

How O
come O
we O
have O
spent O
large O
sums O
of O
money O
, O
in O
exchange O
for O
a O

that O
brings O
irreparable O

Marx O
strictly O
demarcated O
the O
boundary O
between O
scientific O
socialism O
and O
bourgeois O
humanitarianism O
, O
mercilessly O
discarding O
the O
humanitarianism O
of O
the O
capitalist O
class O
. O
Shrewdly O
noting O
that O
after O
scientific O
socialism O
had O
taken O
root O
, O
the O
key O
weakness O
of O
humanitarianism O
=bewitchment O
was O
in O
denying O
revolution O
, O
supplanting O
scientific O
socialism O
. O
While O
the O
Southern O
Weekend O
used O
the O
Wenchuan O
Earthquake O
as O
a O
pretext O
, O
dramatizing O
the O
horror O
and O
tragedy O
of O
the O
earthquake O
, O
to O
take O
the O
opportunity O
to O
beat O
the O
drum O
for O
bourgeois O
humanitarianism O
, O
saying O
, O
" O
The O
sound O
of O
the O
alarm O
was O
a O
wimpering O
, O
sobbing O
, O
but O
even O
more O
a O
call O
, O
calling O
for O
us O
to O
realize O
human O
dignity O
again O
, O
calling O
for O
us O
to O
realize O
value O
of O
life O
again O
. O
" O
As O
if O
our O
socialist O
New O
China O
has O
never O
placed O
importance O
on O
the O
" O
value O
of O
life O
" O
, O
and O
therefore O
needs O
this O
earthquake O
to O
" O
call O
for O
" O
us O
to O
" O
realize O
human O
dignity O
again O
" O
and O
" O
realize O
value O
of O
life O
again O
" O
! O

In O
the O
socialist O
New O
China O
, O
naturally O
there O
is O
n't O
the O
" O
dignity O
" O
of O
landlord O
capitalist O
masters O
, O
even O
during O
the O
crackdown O
on O
counter-revolutionaries O
, O
the O
" O
value O
of O
life O
" O
of O
the O
counter O
revolutionaries O
was O
ruthlessly O
divested O
. O

Instead O
there O
is O
the O
dignity O
of O
workers O
and O
the O
peasants O
not O
to O
be O
oppressed O
and O
exploited O
! O

The O
value O
of O
life O
for O
workers O
and O
peasants O
is O
countless O
times O
higher O
now O
than O
compared O
with O
old O
society O
. O




Secondly O
, O
Tencent O
brought O
the O
time O
and O
user O
dimensions O
together O
. O

This O
so O
- O
called O
time O
refers O
to O
how O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
incident O
, O
after O
Tencent O
had O
promptly O
reported O
it O
, O
it O
launched O
a O
special O
contingency O
plan O
. O

The O
company O
immediately O
made O
a O
decision O
to O
donate O
a O
million O
. O

People O
were O
satisfied O
with O
the O
promptitude O
of O
their O
action O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
Tencent O
also O
increased O
its O
donation O
to O
RMB O
10 O
million O
in O
view O
of O
the O
development O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
becoming O
one O
of O
the O
Internet O
enterprises O
making O
the O
largest O
donations O
to O
the O
earthquake O
disaster O
area O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
as O
this O
, O
each O
of O
Tencent O
's O
main O
platforms O
began O
to O
call O
on O
web O
users O
to O
make O
donations O
, O
and O
the O
integration O
at O
the O
same O
time O
of O
Tenpay O
and O
Tencent O
's O
welfare O
platform O
took O
place O
as O
a O
result O
of O
this O
. O

Users O
could O
not O
only O
support O
the O
disaster O
zone O
by O
making O
donations O
; O
they O
could O
also O
get O
published O
on O
Tencent O
's O
platform O
by O
writing O
articles O
to O
express O
their O
own O
friendly O
wishes O
for O
the O
people O
of O
the O
disaster O
zone O
. O

We O
need O
to O
integrate O
our O
marketing O
focus O
, O
seize O
opportunities O
in O
current O
events O
, O
and O
conduct O
our O
marketing O
as O
appropriate O
. O

We O
need O
to O
lay O
stress O
on O
integrating O
and O
meeting O
the O
different O
needs O
that O
consumers O
have O
of O
our O
products O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
Tencent O
has O
integrated O
all O
kinds O
of O
link O
- O
up O
methods O
. O

This O
so O
- O
called O
" O
link O
- O
up O
" O
refers O
to O
how O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
Tencent O
was O
calling O
for O
disaster O
relief O
, O
it O
was O
using O
all O
kinds O
of O
media O
to O
organize O
and O
publicize O
good O
people O
and O
good O
deeds O
to O
encourage O
more O
enterprises O
and O
individuals O
to O
do O
their O
utmost O
for O
the O
people O
of O
the O

The O
Wenchuan O
Earthquake O
wrought O
massive O
destruction O
on O
those O
in O
its O
path O
. O

According O
to O
incomplete O
statistics O
, O
as O
of O
7 O
pm O
on O
the O
13th O
, O
12,012 O
victims O
had O
died O
in O
the O
Sichuan O
quake O
zone O
, O
9,404 O
people O
were O
buried O
in O
the O
rubble O
, O
7,841 O
were O
missing O
, O
with O
26,206 O
being O
treated O
in O
hospital O
. O

In O
the O
blink O
of O
an O
eye O
, O
more O
than O
ten O
thousand O
souls O
bursting O
with O
life O
departed O
this O
earth O
forever O
, O
in O
the O
blink O
of O
an O
eye O
tens O
of O
thousands O
became O
trapped O
in O
the O
rubble O

For O
those O
who O
already O
died O
, O
we O
can O
but O
regret O
, O
can O
only O
grieve O
. O

However O
, O
most O
distressing O
were O
those O
survivors O
still O
buried O
in O
the O
rubble O
. O

Following O
the O
big O
quake O
was O
an O
accompaniment O
of O
aftershocks O
of O
varying O
sizes O
striking O
at O
random O
, O
along O
with O
stormy O
adverse O
weather O
conditions O

One O
could O
say O
that O
each O
aftershock O
, O
as O
far O
as O
those O
survivors O
were O
concerned O
, O
represented O
an O
extremely O
serious O
danger O
, O
an O
incredibly O
tough O
life O
ordeal O
. O

It O
can O
be O
imagined O
what O
kind O
of O
desperate O

those O

buried O

must O
have O

been O
a O
terribly O
dark O

indeed O
! O

In O
such O
circumstances O
as O
these O
, O
I O
can O
only O
offer O
up O
blessings O
, O
hoping O
beyond O
hope O
that O
those O
people O
still O
surviving O
can O
somehow O
get O
through O
it O
all O
safely O
. O

We O
can O
only O
pray O
, O
pray O
that O
Heaven O
will O
open O
its O
eyes O
and O
protect O
those O
suffering O

We O
can O
only O
call O
out O

Operations O
of O
the O
US O
economy O
is O
much O
reliant O
on O
low O
oil O
prices O
. O

In O
2002 O
, O
international O
oil O
prices O
were O
at O
a O
level O
of O
about O
USD O
$ O
25 O
a O
barrel O
. O

In O
the O
low O
- O
oil O
- O
price O
era O
, O
oil O
spending O
of O
consumers O
only O
accounted O
for O
a O
relatively O
small O
proportion O
of O
their O
individual O
income O
. O

Enterprises O
were O
able O
to O
invest O
and O
expand O
at O
a O
low O
cost O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
in O
the O
low O
- O
oil O
- O
price O
era O
, O
America O
's O
existing O
economic O
model O
was O
able O
to O
continue O
without O
large O
- O
scale O
technological O
revolution O
. O

However O
, O
hedge O
funds O
would O
n't O
approve O
the O
model O
. O

They O
executed O
a O
hedge O
trading O
strategy O
of O
creating O
two O
long O
positions O
: O
simultaneously O
long O
in O
Dow O
Jones O
and O
oil O
. O

Their O
logic O
was O
that O
if O
oil O
prices O
fell O
, O
the O
US O
economy O
would O
prosper O
and O
the O
Dow O
Jones O
stocks O
would O
rise O
, O
the O
absolute O
value O
of O
which O
should O
be O
greater O
than O
the O
fall O
of O
oil O
prices O
; O

if O
oil O
prices O
rise O
, O
Dow O
Jones O
, O
which O
represented O
a O
production O
model O
that O
is O
the O
US O
's O
most O
competitive O
and O
best O
able O
to O
overcome O
high O
oil O
prices O
, O
should O
fall O
at O
an O
absolute O
value O
smaller O
than O
the O
rise O
in O
oil O
prices O
. O

This O
should O
be O
an O
always O
profitable O
hedge O
trading O
strategy O
-LRB- O
specific O

depend O
on O
the O

In O
fact O
I O
used O
to O
write O
frequently O
about O
my O
wife O
. O

She O
, O
of O
course O
, O
should O
be O
my O
girlfriend O
at O
that O
time O
, O
but O
in O
our O
minds O
we O
had O
long O
considered O
ourselves O
as O
husband O
and O
wife O
. O

Days O
of O
triviality O
and O
helplessness O
frittered O
away O
much O
of O
my O
passion O
and O
fantasy O
. O

I O
never O
had O
the O
desire O
to O
smile O
too O
often O
as O
time O
went O
by O
, O
and O
she O
was O
constantly O
concerned O
about O
my O
moodiness O
. O

Yet O
, O
she O
never O
seemed O
to O
have O
any O
reservation O
in O
her O
effort O
and O
contribution O

In O
addition O
to O
taking O
care O
of O
me O
, O
an O
almost O
mentally O
sick O
man O
, O
she O
also O
had O
to O
budget O
carefully O
for O
this O

She O
had O
never O
despised O
me O
for O
my O
poverty O

nor O
had O
she O
ever O
asked O
anything O
from O
me O

At O
one O
time O
, O
she O
just O
longed O
to O
have O
a O
home O

could O
call O
our O
own O

At O
that O
time O
buying O
a O

was O
beyond O
my O
imagination O

Because O
of O
that O
, O
I O
once O
also O
suspected O
whether O
she O
had O
made O
too O
high O
a O
demand O
on O
me O

It O
made O
me O
very O
sad O
during O
that O
period O

However O
, O
I O
also O
knew O
that O
we O
indeed O
needed O
a O
home O

I O
also O
had O
the O
obligation O
to O
give O
her O
a O
home O
. O

She O
came O
to O
this O
strange O
land O
for O
me O
, O
with O
no O
relatives O
or O
friends O
. O

I O
should O
give O
her O
a O
place O
where O
she O
could O
be O
shielded O
from O
winds O
and O
rains O

if O
you O

you O
have O
to O
cross O

Originally O

North B-LOC

not O
set O
up O
any O

the O

It O
was O
only O
after O

the O

that O

, O
after O

it O
is O
still O

the O

A O

We O

After O

if O
we O
did O

get O

it O

I O
think O
each O

definitely O
feel O
extremely O
chagrined O
from O
our O

I O
prayed O
silently O

When O
the O
North B-LOC

finally O
let O
us O

we O
were O
too O

Just O
because O
it O

when O
we O

If O
you O
have O
money O
, O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

But O
among O
the O
working O
class O
, O
if O
a O
couple O
's O
basic O
monthly O
salary O
was O
greater O
by O
just O
one B-MISC
thousand I-MISC
or O
so O
, O
the O
pressure O
from O
a O
mortgage O
would O
definitely O
be O
a O
lot O
less O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
mortgage O
procedures O
are O
becoming O
increasingly O
simple O
and O
the O
conditions O
are O
also O
favorable O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
this O
means O
to O
push O
up O
housing O
prices O
. O

My O
parents O
have O
discussed O
with O
me O
whether O
they O
should O
quickly O
haul O
out O
their O
savings O
to O
buy O
a O
house O
. O

It O
's O
because O
my O
mother O
says O
that O
money O
is O
becoming O
more O
worthless O
over O
the O
time O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
working O
class O
like O
them O
whose O
primary O
income O
is O
the O
salary O
. O

My O
parents O
have O
a O
few O
properties O
and O
have O
only O
rented O
out O
one O
house O
for O
business O
use O
. O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
rent O
one O
gets O
by O
renting O
out O
a O
house O
is O
not O
high O
either O
, O
so O
they O
are O
n't O
expecting O
to O
earn O
much O
from O
the O
rent O
, O
but O
rather O
are O
hoping O
the O
properties O
will O
maintain O
their O
value O
. O

If O
they O
want O
to O
buy O
another O
property O
now O
, O
they O
will O
definitely O
have O
to O
borrow O
from O
the O
bank O
. O

I O
think O
perhaps O
they O
should O
wait O
until O
next O
year O
when O
housing O
prices O
tumble O
. O

Then O
it O
will O
be O
relatively O
worthwhile O
. O

Does O
anybody O
think O
that O
housing O
prices O
could O
fall O
next O
year O
? O




I O

it O

that O
her O

On O
the O

he O
would O

be O
Juliet B-PER

She O

She O
would O
not O

I O

I O

I O
will O
take O

for O
you O

I O

you O

watch O

Because O

On O

, O
and O
his O

He O
was O
a O

and O
his O

. O

The O
two B-MISC
students O
, O
Alexander B-PER

said O
that O
they O
were O
on O

trip O
last B-MISC
Saturday I-MISC

when O
they O
reached O
a O
military O
fortification O

It O
was O
obvious O
that O
man O

foot O
had O
not O
stepped O
on O
this O
place O
for O
a O
long O
time O

. O

The O
two B-MISC
students O
entered O
the O
fortification O
where O
they O
found O
old O
medical O
equipment O
and O
a O
number O
of O
military O
helmets O
and O
a O
canteen O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
military O
pendant O
covered O
with O
mud O

very O
dirty O
. O

The O
two B-MISC
students O
took O
the O
pendant O
home O
with O
them O
and O
cleaned O
it O
and O
washed O
it O
. O

They O
were O
surprised O
that O
it O
did O
not O
belong O
to O
an O
Israeli B-MISC
soldier O
because O
the O
writing O
on O
it O
was O
in O
Arabic B-MISC
and O
they O
did O
not O
understand O
anything O
that O
was O
written O
on O
it O
. O

The O
two B-MISC
students O
took O
the O
pendant O
with O
them O
to O
school O
on O
Sunday B-MISC
and O
tried O
to O
consult O
the O
teacher O
to O
find O
out O
what O
was O
written O
on O
it O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
it O
belonged O
to O
a O
Syrian B-MISC
soldier O
whose O
name O
was O
Mahmoud B-PER
bin I-PER
Ali I-PER
. O

His O
military O
serial O
number O
was O
16241 B-MISC
, O
and O
the O
writing O
also O
indicated O
that O
he O
was O
a O
Muslim B-MISC
and O
his O
blood O
type O
was O
A+ O
. O

A O
senior O
officer O
in O
the O
Israeli B-MISC
army O
who O
fought O
in O
the O
Golan B-MISC
during O
the B-MISC
June I-MISC
War I-MISC
as O
well O
as O
in O
the B-MISC
October I-MISC
War I-MISC
, O
said O
that O
from O
the O
descriptions O
of O
the O
place O
and O
the O
fortification O
given O
by O
the O
two B-MISC
boys O
, O
they O
go O
back O
to O
the O
war O
of O
June B-MISC
1967 I-MISC
, O
because O
the O
Syrian B-MISC
army O
did O
not O
establish O
fortifications O
south O
of O
the O
Golan B-MISC
during O
the B-MISC
October I-MISC
War I-MISC

The O
officer O
added O
that O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
pendant O
in O
the O
place O
together O
with O
medicines O
and O
medical O
equipment O
indicates O
that O
the O
soldier O
was O
injured O
, O
and O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
his O
fate O
is O
still O
unknown O
to O
his O
family O
and O
relatives O
and O
no O
one O
knows O
what O
happened O

him O

The O
strange O

that O

kept O
oblivious O
of O
these O
news O
stories O

broadcasting O
a O
new O

recording O
of O
Saddam B-PER
's O
corpse O
after O
his O
execution O

A O
new O
video O
recording O
depicting O
the O
corpse O
of O
the O
late O
Iraqi B-MISC
president O
Saddam B-PER
Hussein I-PER
after O
his O
execution O
on O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
first B-MISC
day O
of O
the O
Eidul O

was O
broadcasted O
Monday B-MISC
evening I-MISC
on O
the O
Google B-ORG
Internet O
website O
. O

The O
video O
shows O
Saddam B-PER
Hussein I-PER
lying O
covered O
on O
a O
stretcher O
whilst O
the O
camera O
closes O
on O
him O
. O

Then O
the O
covering O
is O
removed O
from O
his O
face O
which O
has O
traces O
of O
blood O
on O
it O
in O
addition O
to O
a O
deep O
wound O
on O
his O
neck O
. O

The O
video O
also O
plays O
voices O
of O
those O
next O
to O
the O
corpse O
speaking O
to O
each O
other O
. O

One B-MISC
of O
them O
says O
" O
quickly O
" O
apparently O
asking O
the O
person O
who O
is O
filming O
to O
do O
it O
quickly O
. O

Someone O
is O
calling O
to O
another O
man O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
saying O

" O

before O
the O
tone O
of O
his O
voice O
starts O
to O
rise O
in O
a O
way O
suggesting O
that O
he O
is O
under O
pressure O
because O
the O
filming O
is O
taking O
too O
long O
. O

The O

not O

This O
unprecedented O
Arab B-MISC
and O
international O
interest O
in O
the O
execution O
of O
Iraqi B-MISC
President O
Saddam B-PER
Hussein I-PER
and O
the O
barbaric O
way O
in O
which O
it O
was O
carried O
out O
, O
confirms O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
man O
, O
his O
prominent O
status O
, O
and O
his O
distinguished O
role O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Arab B-MISC
region O
. O

The O
American B-MISC
administration O
, O
who O
planned O
carefully O
for O
this O
event O
through O
experts O
in O
media O
and O
public O
relations O
, O
and O
its O
tools O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
and O
the O
inclinations O
of O
public O
opinion O
did O
not O
at O
all O
expect O
such O
an O
opposite O
result O
, O
which O
along O
with O
the O
destructive O
consequences O
that O
may O
result O
from O
it O
in O
the B-MISC
coming I-MISC
days I-MISC
have O
caught O
them O
by O
surprise O
. O

Saddam B-PER
Hussein I-PER
proceeded O
to O
the O
gallows O
like O
a O
proud O
mountain O
, O
with O
head O
raised O
, O
standing O
upright O
, O
looking O
down O
at O
the O
insignificant O
things O
and O
insignificant O
people O
, O
believing O
in O
his O
creed O
and O
his O
Arabism B-MISC
, O
repeating O
slogans O
of O
pride O
and O
dignity O
, O
after O
he O
confirmed O
his O
faith O
. O

He O
confirmed O
it O
by O
repeating O
verses O
from O
the O
noble O
Koran B-MISC
and O
the O
two B-MISC
testimonies O
. O

He O
will O
be O
envied O
by O
all O
Arab B-PER
leaders O
, O
both O
living O
and O
dead O
, O
for O
this O
honorable O
martyrdom O
, O
and O
this O
enormous O
love O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
hundreds B-MISC
of I-MISC
millions I-MISC
of O
Arabs B-MISC
and O
Muslims B-MISC
all O
over O
the O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Saddam B-PER
Hussein I-PER
was O
the O
only O
leader O
in O
the O
modern O
history O
of O
this O
nation O
who O
went O
to O
the O
guillotine O
because O
he O
was O
a O
patriot O
who O
refused O
occupation O
and O
surrender O
to O
the O
invasion O
, O
and O
chose O
resistance O
. O

The O
only O
ones O
who O
preceded O
him O
in O
this O
honor O
were O
men O
like O
Umar B-PER
al I-PER
- I-PER
Mukhtar I-PER
and O
Yusuf B-PER
al I-PER
- I-PER
Azma I-PER
, O
by O
whose O
struggle O
the O
nation O
and O
its O
history O
were O
honored O
, O
and O
kept O
it O
for O
them O
in O
the O
records O
of O
pride O
and O
dignity O
. O

They O
hastily O
executed O
him O
because O
they O
feared O
him O
even O
when O
he O
was O
behind O
bars O
, O
just O
as O
they O
will O
still O
fear O
him O
as O
a O
corpse O
hidden O
under O
the O
soil O
of O
the O
homeland O
, O
and O
comparisons O
between O
his O
time O
and O
their O
bloody O
and O
chaotic O
time O
always O
came O
in O
his O
favor O
, O
and O
the O
calls O
for O
his O
return O
to O
save O
Iraq B-LOC
from O
its O
crisis O
and O
the O
corrupt O
and O
malicious O
gang O
that O
governs O
it O
have O
become O
deafening O
to O
the O
ears O
of O
the O
occupation O
and O
its O
accomplices O
. O

He O
embarrassed O
them O
and O
dwarfed O
them O
by O
standing O
as O
a O
spear O
in O
the O
prisoner O
's O
dock O
. O

They O
were O
terrified O
by O
the O
penetrating O
looks O
of O
his O
eyes O
. O

They O
were O
exposed O
by O
his O
patriotism O
and O
Arabism B-MISC
and O
his O
contempt O
for O
the O
odious O
sectarian O
divisions O
that O
they O
planted O
in O
their O
contaminated O
new O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

So O
they O
decided O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him O
with O
a O
confused O
and O
embarrassing O
hastiness O
. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
technology O
of O
the O
mobile O
phone O
which O
enabled O
us O
to O
recognize O
the O
ugly O
face O
of O
the O
hateful O
sectarianism O
that O
is O
governing O
in O
America B-LOC
's O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

This O
tape O
exposed O
the O
government O
of O
the B-LOC
Green I-LOC
Zone I-LOC
, O
and O
blew O
up O
all O
the O
plans O
for O
censorship O
and O
fraud O
by O
the O
experts O
of O
the O
American B-MISC
Intelligence O
service O
and O
their O
agents O
. O

It O
presented O
us O
with O
the O
naked O
truth O
, O
without O
that O
being O
the O
intention O
of O
its O
owner O
. O

He O
was O
right O
when O
he O
turned O
to O
them O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Are O
these O
your O
men O
? O
" O
when O
they O
were O
directing O
insults O
at O
him O
while O
he O
was O
proceeding O
to O
the O
gallows O
in O
magnanimity O
and O
with O
self O
- O
respect O
, O
repeating O
the O
noble O
words O
, O
" O
and O
when O
the O
ignorant O
address O
them O
they O
say O
' O
peace O
. O
' O
" O

Is O
it O
manliness O
to O
shout O
hateful O
sectarian O
slogans O
in O
front O
of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
never O
been O
sectarian O
, O
and O
the O
rope O
of O
the O
gallows O
is O
being O
wound O
around O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
his O
soul O
will O
go O
to O
its O
Creator O
in O
a O
few O
seconds O
? O

Are O
these O
the O
tolerant O
ethics O
of O
Islam B-ORG
? O

Are O
these O
the O
values O
of O
Arabism B-MISC
, O
decency O
, O
and O
pride O
? O

Are O
those O
the O
sons O
of O
the O
great O
Iraq B-LOC
which O
had O
always O
stood O
up O
against O
invaders O
throughout O
history O
and O
was O
a O
pillar O
of O
support O
for O
its O
nation O
and O
the O
causes O
of O
justice O
in O
the O
world O
as O
a O
whole O
? O

We O
are O
sorry O
, O
but O
not O
surprised O
, O
because O
some O
Arab B-MISC
governments O
objected O
only O
because O
the O
execution O
took O
place O
on O
the B-MISC
day I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
feast I-MISC
of I-MISC
Bairam I-MISC
, O
as O
if O
the O
execution O
of O
this O
man O
would O
have O
been O
permissible O
and O
blessed O
on O
any B-MISC
other I-MISC
day I-MISC
. O

We O
are O
sorry O
again O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Arab B-MISC
leaders O
hid O
in O
their O
palaces O
and O
none O
of O
them O
dared O
to O
speak O
even O
one B-MISC
word O
of O
protest O
out O
of O
fear O
of O
America B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
stabbed O
twice O
, O
first B-MISC
when O
we O
watched O
an O
Arab B-MISC
leader O
being O
led O
to O
the O
gallows O
in O
accordance O
with O
sectarian O
justice O
which O
is O
spiteful O
and O
vengeful O
. O
And O
the O
second B-MISC
time O
when O
we O
did O
not O
see O
anyone O
among O
the O
club O
of O
leaders O
to O
which O
he O
belonged O
for O
more O
than O
30 B-MISC
years O
object O
to O
his O
execution O
. O

Maybe O
God O
wanted O
a O
good O
end O
for O
him O
, O
and O
a O
good O
reputation O
, O
when O
He O
induced O
one B-MISC
of O
them O
to O
record O
what O
America B-LOC
and O
the O
government O
of O
sects O
wanted O
to O
hide O
, O
by O
means O
of O
the O
video O
of O
the O
last B-MISC
moments O
, O
which O
created O
a O
historic O
turning O
point O
that O
will O
perhaps O
shape O
the O
history O
of O
the O
region O
, O
and O
the O
nature O
of O
events O
in O
it O
for O
decades B-MISC
to I-MISC
come I-MISC
. O

Maybe O
God O
wanted O
to O
expose O
the O
series O
of O
lies O
of O
Muwaffaq B-PER
al I-PER
- I-PER
Rabi I-PER
the O
National O
Security O
Advisor O
in O
the O
government O
of O
occupation O
. O
-LRB- O
Where O
is O
that O
security O
? O
-RRB- O
, O
who O
went O
out O
to O
the O
world O
saying O
that O
he O
, O
meaning O
President O
Saddam B-PER
, O
was O
weak O
and O
collapsing O
while O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
meet O
his O
God O
. O

Then O
the O
tape O
comes O
along O
and O
shows O
us O
with O
sound O
and O
image O
that O
we O
are O
in O
front O
of O
a O
courageous O
lion O
, O
who O
refuses O
to O
wear O
the O
mask O
, O
just O
as O
he O
refused O
to O
take O
the O
tranquilizing O
pills O
they O
offered O
him O
. O



Why O
the O
mask O
, O
and O
why O
the O
pills O
? O

The O
mask O
is O
for O
traitors O
and O
criminals O
who O
are O
ashamed O
of O
their O
treason O
or O
their O
crimes O
, O
and O
the O
tranquilizing O
pills O
are O
appropriate O
for O
those O
who O
can O
not O
face O
history O
because O
of O
their O
bad O
deeds O
. O

The O
American B-MISC
administration O
committed O
a O
fatal O
mistake O
and O
revealed O
a O
major O
foolishness O
to O
be O
added O
to O
its O
many O
foolishnesses O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
when O
it O
executed O
this O
man O
, O
in O
a O
way O
for O
which O
it O
will O
pay O
a O
hefty O
price O
in O
the B-MISC
near I-MISC
future I-MISC
. O

His O
survival O
would O
have O
benefited O
it O
much O
more O
than O
his O
execution O
if O
they O
understood O
politics O
as O
they O
should O
, O
because O
his O
survival O
could O
have O
been O
a O
card O
to O
threaten O
the O
sectarians O
and O
keep O
them O
as O
servants O
to O
them O
and O
their O
schemes O
, O
just O
as O
it O
could O
have O
been O
a O
bargaining O
chip O
for O
calming O
down O
the O
resistance O
and O
the O
broad O
Iraqi B-MISC
sector O
which O
supports O
it O
. O

But O
they O
do O
not O
know O
anything O
except O
grudges O
, O
and O
they O
do O
not O
want O
anything O
other O
than O
inflicting O
more O
degradation O
on O
the O
Arabs B-MISC
and O
Muslims B-MISC
by O
his O
execution O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
American B-MISC
administration O
will O
have O
succeeded O
in O
one B-MISC
thing O
only O
, O
intentionally O
and O
with O
planning O
or O
without O
it O
, O
namely O
, O
deepening O
the O
sectarian O
breach O
not O
only O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
but O
in O
the O
Islamic B-MISC
world O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

It O
was O
not O
by O
coincidence O
that O
Nouri B-PER
al I-PER
- I-PER
Maliki I-PER
signed O
the O
decision O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
execution O
. O

And O
it O
was O
also O
not O
a O
matter O
of O
coincidence O
that O
the O
task O
of O
carrying O
it O
out O
was O
assigned O
to O
spiteful O
sectarians O
as O
we O

Al B-PER

fled O

along O
with O
all O
those O
who O
participated O
in O
the O
project O
of O
the O
American B-MISC
occupation O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
legitimate O
cover O

from O
the O

This O
execution O
will O
deal O
a O
strong O
blow O
to O
all O
the O
efforts O
of O
national O
reconciliation O
. O

It O
will O
lead O
to O
the O
escalation O
of O
attacks O
against O
the O
American B-MISC
forces O
and O
those O
cooperating O
with O
it O

It O

pour O
more O
oil O
on O
the O
fire O
of O

already O

Those O
who O
carried O
out O
the O
death O
sentence O
do O
not O
want O
reconciliation O
or O
to O
maintain O
a O
unified O
Iraq B-LOC

Rather O
, O
they O
are O
working O
to O
blow O
it O
up O
; O
tolerance O
, O
forgiveness O
, O
and O
patience O
are O
basic O
characteristics O
not O
found O
in O
those O
people O

Saddam B-PER
had O
negative O
traits O
and O
positive O
traits O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
killed O
because O
of O
his O
negative O
traits O
, O
but O
rather O
because O
of O
his O
positive O
traits O
, O
which O
were O
his O
belief O
in O
Arab B-MISC
unity O
, O
resistance O
to O
the O
enemies O
of O
the O
nation O
, O
building O
an O
unprecedented O
industrial O

He O
chose O
resistance O
and O
rejected O
safe O

The O
curse O
of O
Saddam B-PER
will O
continue O
to O
chase O
them O

chase O
the O
Americans B-MISC

chase O
his O
spiteful O

executioners O

Just O

so O
he O
said O
to O
let O
your O
wife O
do O
it O
you O
know O

%uh O
right O

he O
says O
%uh O
you O
know O
no O
I O
'm O
going O
to O

%eh O
so O
now O
I O
'm O
at O
a O
point O
that O
it O
's O
very O
strange O

like O
I O
wo O
n't O
complain O
about O
anything O

or O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
about O
anything O

and O
I O
ca O
n't O
ask O
him O
to O
come O
help O
me O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
when O
I O
forgot O
to O
take O
out O
something O
they O
put O
in O
the O
freezer O

So O
we O
'll O
see O
how O
it O
goes O

hopefully O

I O
mean O
they O
promise O
me O
you O
know O
everybody O
that O
they O
're O
going O
to O
help O
me O
and O
that O
whatever O
I O
say O

But O
you O
know O
everybody O
gives O
you O
%uh O
these O
%uh O
pro- O

yeah O

so O
you O
've O
already O
started O

Well O
I O
've O
started O
working O
with O
Du O

like O
I O
do O
n't O
cook O
anymore O

I O
have O
n't O
worked O
in O
the O
kitchen O
for O
a O
week O
already O

I O
've O
been O
just O
doing O
with O
him O
learning O
how O
to O
do O
the O
orders O
and O
meeting O
all O
the O
%um O
sales O
people O

and O
%um O
I O
've O
learned O
how O
to O
work O
the O
computer O
which O
is O
the O
bigges- O

I O
said O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
even O

really O

So O
I O
'm O
not O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
could O
do O
it O
yet O
by O
myself O

but O
he O
's O
showing O
me O
teaching O
me O

and O
I O
think O
like O
the O
middle O
of O
this O
week O
he O
'll O
be O
there O
a B-MISC
few I-MISC
days I-MISC
with O
me O

and O
then O
anoth- O

he O
%um O

Maybe O
here O
and O
there O

but O
he O
's O
really O
basically O

What O
is O
he O
going O
to O
do O

He O
's O
going O
to O
be O
a O
teacher O
for O
%um O
High O
school O
computers O

oh O
okay O

yeah O

so O
he O
's O
only O
teaching O
three B-MISC
days I-MISC
a O
week O

so O
he O
always O
says O
that O
on O
the O
other O
days O
if O
I O
need O
him O
he O
'll O
come O
in O

the O
truth O
is O
he O
's O
been O
teaching O
and O
very O
patient O
and O
very O
good O

and O
he O
also O
is O
great O
that O
he O
has O
written O
down O
everything O

I O
'm O
sure O
he O
's O
thrilled O
to O
get O
out O
of O
there O

Well O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
%uh O

I O
mean O
now O
that O
I O
worked O
with O
him O
one O
to O
one O
He O
does O
do O
everything O
with O
his O
heart O

I O
mean O
he O
has O
a O
different O
head O
than O
everybody O
else O

like O
I O
know O
that O
he O
wants O
everything O
to O
be O
nice O
and O
to O
be O
good O
and O

but O
he O
's O
very O
separate O

and O
he O
does O
n't O
like O
to O
listen O
to O
other O
people O
's O
%um O
ideas O

but O
%um O
I O
'm O
sure O
financially O
he O
was O
probably O
great O
for O
the O
kibbutz O
because O
he O
was O
cheap O

yeah O

because O
he O
's O
also O

I O
'll O
tell O
you O

I O
worked O
with O
him O
this O
whole O
week O

he O
does O
n't O
eat O
a O
thing O
ever O

like O
all O
morning O
long O

so O
he O
does O
n't O
eat O

he O
does O
n't O
drink O
coffee O

I O
did O
n't O
see O
him O
drink O
anything O
water O
or O
anything O
else O

one O
day O
he O
said O
I O
better O
drink O
something O
I O
have O
a O
headache O
because O
it O
was O
really O
hot O

but O
I O
mean O
you O
know O
he O
does O
n't O
eat O
anything O

and O
then O
for O
lunch O
when O
we O
finally O
went O
to O
go O
get O
something O
to O
eat O
Also O
he O
eats O
like O
a O
little O
What O
we O
would O
eat O
maybe O
half O
for O
a O
meal O

and O
that O
's O
it O

so O
I O
can O
understand O
now O
why O
he O
thinks O
that O
because O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
big O
eyes O
you O
know O

right O

that O
's O
so O
funny O

but O
anyway O

no O

so O
he O
had O
agreed O
to O
do O
it O
for O
a B-MISC
year I-MISC

and O
his O
year O
is O
over O

I O

are O
you O
excited O
at O
all O
about O
it O

or O

well O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O

until O
I O
made O
the O
decision O
I O
was O
scared O
and O
also O
utz O

I O
miss O
the O
cooking O
part O

You O
miss O
it O

that O
's O
funny O

I O

yeah O

yeah O

like O
this O
week O
even O
when O
they O
made O
the O
%um O
coleslaw O
you O
know O
& O
kept O
calling O
me O
to O
taste O
it O
and O
make O
sure O
that O
it O
was O
the O
way O
that O
I O
do O
it O

and O
so O
Matty B-PER
said O
to O
me O
Ellen B-PER
you O
did O
n't O
make O
the O
coleslaw O

I O
said O
it O
's O
over O
you O
know O

I O
ca O
n't O
do O
everything O

tha- O

and O
they O
're O
going O
to O
notice O
that O
the O
cooking O
is O
different O

Well O
that O
's O
what O
even O
**ruthie** O
says O
you O
know O

everyone O
thinks O
that O
the O
economie O
is O
so O
important O

but O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
that O
are O
very O
important O
of O
running O
the O
kitchen O

and O
we O
'll O
see O

%uh O
right O
now O
Ramon B-PER
%uh O



you O
know O
Cocoa B-PER
she O
got O
married O

She O
married O
that O
guy O

not O
the O
Israeli B-MISC
guy O
not O
the O
Sephardic B-MISC
guy O
but O
No O
you O
're O
kidding O
that O
little O
feminine O
kind O
of O
guy O

No O

but O
reme- O

when O
I O
was O
there O
in O
October B-MISC
she O
had O
that O
guy O
from O
Yerushalaim B-LOC
that O
guy O

yeah O

820.26_822.65_B: O
no O

but O
%um O
it O
was O
over O
already O
around O
then O

but O
they O
were O
still O
friends O

and O
this O
guy O
was O
a O
here O
or O
something O
drawer O

I O
think O
his O
family O
is O
Romanian B-MISC
or O
something O

anyway O

yeah O

it O
was O
very O
fast O

and O
they O
got O
married O

How O
old O
is O
she O
? O

She O
's O
eighteen B-MISC
and I-MISC
a I-MISC
half I-MISC

she O
'll O
be O
nineteen B-MISC
in O
December B-MISC

oh O
my O
god O

why O
did O
they O
allow O
that O

Well O
I O
guess O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
choice O

but O
the O
worst O
thing O
was O
originally O
when O
she O
came O
to O
her O
parents O
and O
she O
was O
going O
to O
get O
married O
she O
was O
going O
to O
get O
married O
in O
October B-MISC

but O
she O
got O
engaged O
like O
before O
Pesach B-MISC

so O
going O
to O
get O
married O
in O
October B-MISC

so O
they O
were O
n't O
so O
thrilled O

but O
at O
least O
okay O
it O
's O
%uh O

and O
then O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
they O
came O
back O
and O
said O
no O
we O
want O
to O
get O
married O

they O
got O
married O
the O
I O
think O
oh O
my O
g- O
second B-MISC
week I-MISC
in I-MISC
June I-MISC

on O
kibbutz O

yeah O

it O
was O
beautiful O

we O
do O
weddings O
%eh O
so O
much O
nicer O
than O
in O
the O
old O
days O

first O
of O
all O
we O
rent O
tables O
and O
chairs O

yeah O

so O
it O
's O
like O

and O
we O
did O
it O
on O
the O
grass O
outside O
the O

and O
it O
was O
beautiful O

we O
read O

that O

so O
she O
's O
like O
the O
first O
child O
who O
got O
married O

right O

and O
we O
rented O
beautiful O
china O
and O
silverware O
and O
glasses O

wow O

beautiful O

I O
must O
admit O
it O
was O
really O
really O
beautiful O

and O
then O
serving O
everything O
we O
use O
like O
%um O
all O
different O
kinds O
of O
bought O
kind O
of O
%um O
paper O
plates O
that O

uh-huh O

probably O
like O
the O
hard O
plastic O

and O
it O
was O
amazing O
because O
they O
even O
had O
like O
a O
bar O
set O
up O

and O
they O
had O
oh O
my O
go- O
fruit O

they O
had O
hay O

and O
then O
they O
had O
fruit O

it O
was O
gorgeous O

it O
was O
absolutely O
gorgeous O

Does O
she O
now O
have O
to O
do O
tzavah O
or O
no O

no O
no O

but O
%ah O
marriage O
is O

you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
do O
the O
tzavah O

oh O
my O
go- O

So O
she O
's O
working O
now O
in O
the O
vegetarian O
kitchen O
and O
the O
a O
little O
bit O

but O
she O
's O
going O
to O
study O
in O
September B-MISC

so O
that O
's O
not O
so O
long O

Does O
she O
cover O
her O
hair O

No O

oh O
I O
keep O

that O
other O
guy O
was O
real O

this O
one O
is O

I O
can O
not O
bel- O

oh O
this O
other O
one O
's O
like O
from O
a O
family O
that O
's O
not O
at O
all O

but O
he O

yeah O

they O
went O
to O
America B-LOC
for O
a B-MISC
month I-MISC
after O
the O
wedding O

her O
grandparents O
sent O
them O
%uh O
oh O
my O
Even O
though O
they O
were O
mad O

you O
know O
the O
typical O
Ariella B-PER
story O

they O
came O
for O
Pesach B-MISC

and O
then O
they O
told O
them O

they O
waited O
to O
tell O
them O
that O
they O
got O
engaged O

and O
the O
wedding O
is O
in O
June B-MISC

and O
they O
were O
so O
angry O
because O
how O
the O
hell O
could O
they O
come O
back O
after O
years O

that O
's O
true O

No O

so O
on O
one O
hand O
I O
understand O
them O

it O
's O
not O
fair O

No O
of O
course O
not O

965.04_967.89_B: O
even O
they O
could O
have O
called O
them O
before O
Pesach B-MISC

maybe O
they O
would O
've O
changed O
their O
minds O

but O

wait O

yeah O

Natan B-PER
's O
sister O
was O
here O
also O

So O
they O
were O
all O
upset O
that O
the O
grandparents O
did O
n't O
come O
back O
for O
the O
wedding O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

you O
have O
to O
look O
at O
you O
know O
both O



oh O
my O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
she O
got O
married O

I O

she O
got O
married O

and O
then O
the O
week O
after O
Ta'al B-PER
Paer I-PER
got O
married O

you O
know O
Ta'al B-PER
is O
the O
oldest O
%uh O
girl O
on O
the O

I O

yeah O

where O
is O
she O
living O

Well O
her O
husband O
he O
looks O
like O
Mickey B-PER
our O
Mickey B-PER
yeah O
when O
Mickey B-PER
was O
really O
young O

so O
he O
looks O
really O
young O

%uh O
she O
just O
finished O
now O
the O
army O

and O
she O
met O
him O
during O
the O
army O

he O
's O
from O
a O
nonreligious O
kibbutz O

oh O
my O
gosh O

yeah O

So O
now O
they O
're O
living O
on O
his O
kibbutz O
%um O
because O
they O
allow O
like O
B'nai B-MISC
to O
live O
there O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
they O
can O
work O
outside O
yeah O
do O
whatever O
they O
want O
until O
they O
decide O
what O
they O
want O
or O
do O
what O
they O
want O

do O
whatever O
they O
want O

study O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
're O
doing O

his O
parents O
are O
n't O
even O
living O
on O
the O
kibbutz O
anymore O
because O
he O
's O
a O
professor O
of O
something O
or O
other O
in O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
China B-LOC
or O
somewhere O

Singapore B-LOC

I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O

anyway O
so O
that O
was O
really O
weird O

like O
when O
she O
got O
engaged O
it O
was O
a O
little O
hard O
for O
Rachel B-PER
because O
he O
's O
not O
religious O
and O
everyone O
was O
really O
upset O

gosh O
you O
would O
think O
at O
least O
in O
Israel B-LOC
you O
would O
get O
what O
you O
want O

No O

but O
not O
only O
that O

what O

this O
kid O
just O
left O
the O
kibbutz O
at O
eighteen B-MISC

and O
now O
at O
nineteen B-MISC
he O
's O
coming O
back O
with O
&uh O
you O
know O
like O

He O
also O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
boyfriends O
during O
her O
lifetime O

anyway O
to O
make O
a O
long O
story O
short O
she O
had O
her O
wedding O
also O

but O
hers O
we O
did O
like O
%um O
a O
buffet O

so O
I O
was O
really O
nervous O
about O
that O
because O
when O
did O
we O
ever O
do O
a O
buffet O

so O
we O
rented O
the O
tables O
and O
chairs O
again O

and O
we O
rented O
all O
the O
beautiful O
dishes O

yeah O

But O
we O
set O
up O
the O
buffet O

we O
bought O
like O
these O
really O
neat O

you O
know O
like O
they O
're O

Well O
we O
saved O
them O
because O
you O
can O
wash O
them O

they O
're O
made O
out O
of O
plastic O

but O
they O
look O
like O
silver O
trays O

uh-huh O

yeah O

So O
we O
bought O
all O
different O
shapes O
and O
sizes O

and O
we O
put O
out O
the O
salads O
and O
the O
meats O
and O
all O
different O
kinds O
that O

we O
had O
%um O
little O
cocktail O
hot O
dogs O

and O
we O
had O
chicken O
legs O

and O
we O
had O
schnitzels O

oh O
and O
they O
made O
a O
beautiful O
basket O
with O
breads O
you O
know O
everything O
falling O
out O
on O
the O
table O

you O
know O
those O
kind O
of O
things O

no O

wow O

No O

it O
was O
beautiful O

it O
also O
came O
out O
really O
nice O

the O
only O
thing O

you O
guys O
must O
feel O
so O
old O
that O
you O
have O
married O
children O
already O

yeah O

we O
do O
feel O
old O

and O
it O
was O
beautiful O

Ramona B-PER
's O
was O
nicer O
because O
they O
had O
a O
great O
band O
and O
everybody O
was O
that O

you O
know O
like O
usually O
in O
a O
wedding O
there O
's O
no O
room O
to O
dance O

but O
the O
whole O
parking O
lot O
was O
for O
dancing O

and O
on O
the O
grass O
was O
where O
we O
sat O

wow O

uh-huh O

so O
it O
was O
like O
as O
if O
you O
would O
've O
seen O
you O
know O
dance O
festival O
because O
there O
was O
like O
a O
circle O
of O
men O
a O
circle O
of O
girls O
a O
circle O
of O
her O
friends O
a O
circle O
of O
his O
friends O
because O
there O
was O
enough O
room O
the O
kids O
had O
a O
circle O
that O
you O
could O
have O
like O
five O
six O
different O
circles O
all O
over O
the O
place O

oh O
my O
gosh O

it O
was O
beautiful O

and O
Ta'al O
's O

what O
happened O

you O
know O
that O
Rachel B-PER
was O
really O
worried O
that O
people O
wo O
n't O
dance O
for O
her O
be O
happy O
for O
her O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O

that O
was O
ridiculous O
because O
everyone O
was O
just O
as O
happy O

but O
her O
band O
they O
got O
stuck O
somewhere O

and O
their O
%um O

something O
with O
the O
electric O
equipment O

it O
did O
n't O
come O

so O
we O
had O
to O
get O
from O
us O
the O
amplifiers O

and O
ours O
are O
terrible O

%mm O
oy O

they O
could O
n't O
hear O
anything O

so O
So O
some O
people O
got O
really O
you O
know O

just O
they O
did O
n't O
dance O

and O
she O
was O
really O
upset O

I O
said O
Rachel B-PER
why O
did O
you O
even O
bother O
paying O
them O

Well O
that O
's O
true O

getting O
this O
really O
great O
group O

and O
even O
if O
we O
would O
've O
known O
they O
were O
stuck O
so O
call O
the O
kibbutz O

we O
would O
've O
sent O
the O
car O
to O
go O
get O
it O

right O

oh O
gosh O

so O
that O
was O
bad O
news O

but O
other O
than O
that O

so O
anybody O
else O
engaged O

not O
yet O

the O
rest O
are O
young O

well O
that O
whole O
class O
that O
whole O
first O

no O

but O
there O
was O
only O
those O
two B-MISC
girls O
Ta'al B-PER
from O
the O
first B-MISC
class O

Ramona B-PER
from O
the O
second B-MISC

now O
these O
other O
kids O
just O
finished O
high O
school O

like O
& O
's O
oldest O
daughter O
is O
going O
to O
the O
army O
next B-MISC
week I-MISC
or O
two B-MISC
weeks I-MISC

wow O

but O
does O
n't O
she O
have O
a O
son O
who O
's O
older O

yeah O

her O
son O
is O
still O
in O
the O
army O

uh-huh O

no O

but O
he O
's O
not O
engaged O
yet O

I O
think O
boys O
wait O
a O
little O
longer O

mhm O

yeah O
maybe O

Is O
Liat B-PER
still O
going O
with O
that O
guy O
? O




yeah O

until O
like O
you O
find O
something O
that O
is O
n't O
stressful O
and O
not O
boring O
. O

yeah O

that O
's O
the O
main O
two B-MISC
combinations O
right O
? O

yeah O
. O

Not O
stressful O
and O
not O
boring O

yeah O
. O

Well O
it O
's O
like O
I O
have O
no O
problems O
with O
secretarial O
work O

okay O
that O
's O
what O
fitted O
in O
to O
that O
category O
because O
if O
you O
are O
a O
busy O
enough O
secretary O
you O
know O
%eh O
%mm O
. O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
bored O
because O
you O
are O
always O
doing O
something O
different O

and O
if O
your O
employer O
is O
a O
relatively O
decent O
human O
being O
you O
know O
two B-MISC
if's O
there O

mhm O
. O

but O
you O
get O
no O
respect O

I O
mean O
oh O
you O
're O
a O
secretary O

and O
the O
pay O
is O
pretty O
crummy O

well O
it O
's O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
as O
what O
I O
'm O
getting O
you O
know O
%um O
depending O
upon O
where O
you O
work O
and O
all O

but O
you O
know O
it O
's O
like O
that O
's O
no O
answer O
either O

so O
I O
've O
just O
been O
toying O
with O
this O
idea O
of O
going O
back O
to O
school O
and O
getting O
a O
computer O
science O
degree O
so O
I O
can O
always O
be O
gainfully O
employed O
. O

But O
anyway O
, O

and O
you O
can O
think O
about O
that O
pregnancy O
thing O

oh O
yeah O

that O
pregnancy O
thing O

yeah O

that O

do O
the O

Maybe O
there O
's O
your O
hormones O
calling O
. O

yeah O

well O
no O

the O
funny O
thing O
is O
it O
's O
like O
ten O
years O
ago O
I O
would O
've O
said O
oh O
yeah O
that O
was O
what O
I O
really O
wanted O
to O
be O
doing O
is O
having O
a O
baby O
you O
know O

but O
like O
at O
this O
point O
in O
time O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
like O
we O
're O
going O
to O
do O
it O
because O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
%uh O
%eh O
you O
know O
in B-MISC
the I-MISC
next I-MISC
year I-MISC
or O
two B-MISC
we O
'd O
regret O
it O
you O
know O

we O
figure O
it O
's O
something O
we O
'd O
want O
to O
do O

it O
's O
not O
like O
we O
're O
doing O
it O
because O
we O
have O
to O
do O
it O
or O
there O
's O
peer O
pressure O

or O
well O
a O
%mm O
little O
peer O
pressure O

oh O
no O
no O
no O

I O
know O
exactly O
where O
you O
're O
at O
because O
I O
think O
about O
that O
too O

I O
got O
about O
like O
six B-MISC
or O
seven B-MISC
years I-MISC

I O
figure O
my O
body O
is O
a O
very O
slow O
%um O
yeah O
**maturer** O

you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O

like O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
my O
period O
until O
I O
was O
sixteen B-MISC

I O
mean O
I O
look O
like O
about O
%uh O
%uh O
at O
least O
five B-MISC
or O
six B-MISC
years I-MISC
younger O
than O
I O
actually O
am O

-- O
and O
I O
'm O
just O
starting O
to O
get O
my O
period O
actually O
now O
-- O
yeah O
yeah O
as O
an O
adult O
. O

So O
I O
kind O
of O
figure O
well O
I O
'm O
probably O
good O
until O
at O
least O
some O
time O
in O
the B-MISC
early I-MISC
forties I-MISC

and O
I O
could O
probably O
go O
a O
little O
longer O
than O
that O

I O
know O
there O
's O
a O
risk O
and O
all O
that O
bullshit O

yeah O
. O

but O
%um O
yeah O
I O
think O
about O
that O
too O
because O
it O
's O
like O
I O
mean O
I O
kind O
of O
like O
the O
way O
things O
are O
going O
in O
the O
total O
lack O
of O
responsibility O
. O

I O
know O

well O
I O
mean O
that O
's O
the O
thing O

kids O
are O
cute O
and O
all O
that O

and O
we O
%mm O
slept O
until O
noon B-MISC

we O
got O
up O
about B-MISC
ten I-MISC
and O
was O
like O
oh O
we O
have O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
played O
with O
the O
cats O
fell O
back O
to O
sleep O

okay O
I O
mean O
we O
're O
talking O
total O
slackers O

%mm O

and O
I O
thought O
gee O
you O
know O
if O
we O
had O
a O
kid O
we O
could O
n't O
do O
this O
you O
know O

and O

%mm O

No O

you O
got O
to O
be O
focused O
on O
that O

and O
I O
mean O
there O
's O
a O
lots O
of O
other O
things O
that O

I O
mean O
as O
far O
as O
like O
living O
situation O
I O
was O
feeling O
kind O
of O
settled O
you O
know O
like O
-- O
Right O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
be O
like O
traipsing O
around O

but O
I O
mean O
I O
could O
say O
that O
for O
the O
next O
five B-MISC
or O
even O
eight B-MISC
or O
maybe O
-- O
yeah O
. O
-- O
ten B-MISC
years I-MISC
alright O

even O
if O
I O
could O
project O
that O
far O
which O
I O
really O
ca O
n't O

yeah O

but O
I O
mean O
you O
got O
a O
kid O
you O
ca O
n't O
do O
fucking O
ten B-MISC
years I-MISC
w- O
-- O

I O
know O
. O

-- O
it O
's O
like O
cool O
I O
think O
I O
'll O
go O
off O
to O
the O
Orient B-MISC
and O
start O
like O
bouncing O
from O
country O
country O
. O

I O
know O

well O
and O
I O
mean O
okay O
Emory B-PER
wants O
to O
get O
his O
doctorate O

so O
we O
'll O
know O
next O
Spring O
if O
he O
can O
get O
at O
least O
accepted O
into O
the O
program O
which O
hopefully O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
you O
know O

and O
then O
there O
's O
four B-MISC
or O
five B-MISC
years I-MISC
doing O
the O
damn O
work O

and O
%mm O
. O
He O
's O
crazy O

he O
wants O
it O

that O
's O
fine O

he O
can O
do O
it O

no O
problem O

but O
%um O
that O
sort O
of O
ties O
us O
up O
here O
although O
we O
like O
the O
place O

we O
're O
in O
no O
hurry O
to O
leave O
it O

yeah O
. O

and O
that O
would O
be O
good O

But O
then O
you O
know O
what O
if O
he O
could O
get O
a O
position O
overseas O
again O
which O
is O
something O
both O
of O
us O
have O
said O
would O
be O
pretty O
darn O
good O
because O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
%um O
you O
know O
after O
coming O
back O
from O
Spain O
from O
those B-MISC
two I-MISC
and I-MISC
half I-MISC
years I-MISC
it O
was O
n't O
so O
much O
an O
adjustment O
to O
the O
way O
things O
were O

it O
's O
just O
asking O
the O
question O
gee O
do O
we O
really O
like O
%um O
the O
way O
things O
are O
over O
here O
with O
the O
lifestyle O
the O
nine B-MISC
to O
five B-MISC
kind O
of O
thing O

I O
mean O
I O
'm O
really O
in O
the O
nine B-MISC
to O
five B-MISC
thing O
more O
so O
than O
he O
is O

you O
know O
he O
should O
be O
there O
by O
oh O
oh O
well O
let O
's O
say O
eight B-MISC
thirty I-MISC
to O
nine B-MISC

but O
yeah O

he O
does O
n't O
care O
when O

well O
okay O

%um O
and O
his O
professor O
is O
obviously O
%uh O
%uh O
a O
great O
person O
to O
work O
for O

so O
I O
'm O
envious O

but O
%um O
whatever O

you O
know O
I O
'm O
caught O
up O
%mm O
. O
-- O
in O
it O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
you O
know O

too O
many O
days O
I O
'm O
working O
and O
eating O
at O
my O
desk O
at O
about B-MISC
twelve I-MISC
o'clock I-MISC

and O
I O
'm O
thinking O
%mm O
. O
This O
is O
crazy O
you O
know O

in O
Spain B-LOC
%uh O
we O
had O
this O
break O

and O
you O
sat O

you O
talked O
to O
people O
you O
know O

you O
enjoyed O
your O
food O

you O
relaxed O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
you O
know O

and O
it O
's O
a O
fairly O
productive O
nation O
right O
you O
know O

What O
's O
going O
on O
here O
? O



yeah O

I O
mean O
they O
both O
have O
the O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O

what O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
concentrate O
on O
the O
advantages O
in O
what O
ever O
place O
you O
're O
in O
-- O
mhm O
-- O
and O
think O
about O
the O
disadvantages O
of O
the O
place O
that O
you O
're O
not O
in O
. O

yeah O

Otherwise O
you O
go O
nuts O
right O
? O

That O
's O
true O
, O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
know O
Laura B-PER
tried O
to O

%uh O
because O
we O
have O
email O
and O
so O
she O
sent O
me O
a O
letter O
back O
saying O
you O
know O
remember O
how O
crowded O
the O
transportation O
is O
and O
%uh O
what O
else O
-- O
%mm O
. O
how O
expensive O
everything O
is O

and O
%uh O
you O
know O
I O
remember O
those O
things O
of O
course O
you O
know O
-- O

And O
work O
you O
know O
possibilities O
were O
a O
lot O
more O
limited O

True O
. O

and O
the O
language O
you O
know O
yeah O
. O
constantly O
like O
kind O
of O

like O
I O
mean O
those O
could O
be O
considered O
positive O
things O
as O
well O

yeah O

but O
I O
mean O
you O
mind O
as O
well O
think O
of O
them O
in O
a O
negative O
vie- O
rather O
than O

mhm O
sure O

They O
just O
like O
worrying O
over O
them O
. O

Well O
you O
know O
and O
that O
's O
why O
it O
helps O
to O
have O
kind O
of O
a O
glimpse O
into O
the O
future O
right O
? O

And O
that O
's O
how O
we O
got O
to O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
Spain B-LOC
in O
the O
first B-MISC
place O
is O
we O
said O
we O
wanted O
to O
live O
abroad O
and O
we O
would O
try O
to O
do O
it O
you O
know O
as O
teachers O

and O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
way O
because O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
we O
had O
this O
idea O
of O

and O
I O
really O
feel O
that O
that O
's O
important O

and O
so O
what O
I O
'm O
having O
an O
idea O
of O
now O
is O

okay O
you O
know O
Emory B-PER
works O
on O
his O
doctorate O

it O
takes O
about O
five B-MISC
or O
six B-MISC
years I-MISC

we O
have O
the O
kid O
probably O

he O
gets O
a O
research O
position O
somewhere O
in O
France B-LOC
or O
in O
Spain B-LOC
%um O

and O
then O
we O
move O
over O
there O

and O
you O
know O
I O
take O
care O
of O
the O
kid O
and O
do O
some O
you O
know O
little O
day O
labor O
whatever O
you O
know O

we O
'll O
see O

%mm O
. O

%um O
and O
we O
have O
relatively O
mellow O
life O
for O
who O
knows O
five B-MISC
or O
ten B-MISC
years I-MISC

and O
then O
we O
take O
it O
from O
there O
. O

yeah O

because O
even O
like O
you O
know O
I O
mean O
all O
that O
stuff O
right O
is O
all O
so O
subject O
to O
whatever O
change O
in O
the O
weather O
that O
happens O
to O
be O
right O
? O

mhm O
. O

oh O
I O
know O

I O
know O

and O
it O
's O
like O
you O
know O
what O
I O
think O
because O
I O
get O
the O
same O
as O
you O

like O
some O
days O
it O
's O
just O
kind O
of O
like O
you O
know O
what O
the O
hell O
am O
I O
doing O
not O
with O
my O
life O
but O
ge- O

but O
I O
mean O
just O
like O
where O
do O
I O
get O
the O
animal O
just O
you O
know O
to O
do O
anything O
you O
know O

I O
just O
lay O
in O
bed O
and O
dream O
for O
the O
whole O
day O
easily O

yeah O

I O
know O
. O

Well O
I O
know O

I O
know O
what O
you O
're O
saying O

I O
feel O
there O
's O
sort O
of O
a O
line O
to O
cross O
too O
between O
really O
planning O
it O
out O
and O
worry O
and O
stressing O
over O
it O
because O
for O
a O
while O
a O
couple O
months O
back O
there O
I O
was O
thinking O
in O
terms O
of O
oh O
gosh O
you O
know O
can O
we O
ever O
afford O
a O
house O

%mm O
. O

and O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
and O
sort O
of O
looked O
at O
it O
financially O
and O
said O
is O
this O
what O
we O
really O
want O
to O
be O
worrying O
about O
right O
now O

and O
you O
know O
I O
realize O
no O

yeah O
absolutely O
. O

and O
so O
you O
know O
you O
can O
sort O
of O
focus O
too O
much O
on O
the O
future O

or O
I O
know O
I O
have O
this O
tendency O
to O
do O

like O
no O
pleasure O
that O
's O
as O
intense O
as O
the O
one O
that O
you O
are O
experiencing O
at O
that O
moment O
you O
know O

you O
can O
think O
about O
what O
something O
might O
be O
like O
or O
reminisce O
about O
the O
past O

but O
like O
when O
you O
're O
there O
in O
that O
moment O
it O
's O

I O
mean O
everything O

kind O
of O
like O

almost O
like O
time O

You O

one O
of O
the O
best O
moments O

a O
special O

and O
you O
know O
you O
might O
need O
a O
reservation O
too O

yeah O
%um O

yeah O

I O
will O

I O
should O
have O
some O
visitors O

and O
my O
family O
's O
planning O
on O
coming O
this O
summer O

so O
I O
'll O
take O
them O
there O
and O
this O
fondue O
place O
I O
wanted O
to O
take O
them O
to O
also O
. O

yeah O
yeah O

Is O
the O
one O
over O
in O
Gracia B-LOC
that O

it O
's O
kind O
of O
on O
a O
corner O
I O
think O

I O
think O
I O

%uh O

no O

there O
's O
a O
couple O
places O
in O
Gracia B-LOC
that O
I O
've O
been O
going O
to O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
%uh O
there O
's O
one O
in O
the O
%um O
Bario B-MISC
Gottigo I-MISC

actually O
it O
's O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
Leotana B-LOC
%huh O
. O
Like O
down O
over O
by O
the O
Bornillo O

okay O
. O

And O
I O
've O
only O
eaten O
there O
once O
alright O

but O
I O
've O
been O
in O
a O
million O
times O
because O
every O
time O
I O
pass O
with O
somebody O
I O
have O
to O
show O
them O
the O
place O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Actually O
you O
know O
I O
know O
where O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
go O

I O
have O
a O
friend O
my O
friend O
from O
England B-LOC

I O
do O
n't O
remember O
if O
I O
told O
you O
about O
her O

she O
's O
my O
old O
%um O
roommate O
mhm O
. O
From O
Oviato B-LOC

and O
she O
's O
coming O

she O
got O
a O
job O
down O
here O

she O
's O
coming O
on O
Friday B-MISC
to O
live O

mhm O

And O
%ah O
I O

this O
is O
like O
the O
perfect O

because O
when O
we O
lived O
in O
Oviato B-LOC
we O
used O
to O
go O
to O
this O
fondue O
place O
all O
the O
time O

that O
would O
be O
the O
perfect O
place O
to O
take O
her O
when O
she O
gets O
her O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

well O
I O
'm O
glad O
to O
hear O
that O
you O
got O
a O
job O
that O
you O
like O
and O
%uh O
%um O
think O
that O
you O
were O
able O
to O
stay O

I O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
worried O
at O
first O
you O
know O
when O
you O
got O
back O
there O
because O
the O
money O
would O
run O
out O
probably O
in O
April B-MISC
or O
so O

and O
you O
know O

yeah O

And O
I O
mean O
I O
knew O
I O
would O
get O
a O
job O

and O
after O
I O
just O
stopped O
thinking O
about O
it O
I O
just O
thought O
well O
fuck O
it O

I O
am O
going O

it O
's O
like O
inevitable O

and O
I O
want O
something O

I O
have O
to O
get O
something O

and O
I O
will O

uh-huh O

%um O
%huh O

But O
I O
just O
thought O
that O
you O
know O
I O
'll O
get O
a O
job O

and O
at O
this O
point O
if O
I O
get O
desperate O
I O
'll O
just O
have O
to O
take O
anything O

yeah O
. O

And O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
like O
kind O
of O
fell O
into O
something O
that O
's O
Fairly O
sweet O

I O
mean O
%eh O
in O
the O
beginning O
everything O
kind O
of O
starts O
out O
nice O

but O
I O
'm O
changing O
my O
attitude O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
get O
stressed O
out O
about O
it O
too O
much O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
try O
to O
change O
anything O

Good O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
go O
in O
there O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
do O
a O
nice O
job O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
have O
a O
good O
time O
uh-huh O
. O
you O
know O

and O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
not O
the O
same O

I O
'm O
either O

like O
from O
working O
with O
kids O

I O
mean O
that O
was O
like O
you O
know O
my O
career O
for O
like B-MISC
eight I-MISC
years I-MISC

mhm O
. O

But O
this O
is O
you O
know O
more O
like O

it O
's O
nice O

it O
's O
really O
nice O

Well O
and O
you O
can O
always O
go O
back O
to O
that O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
you O
know O
working O
at O
least O
in O
the O
States O

or O
maybe O
eventually O
once O
you O
have O
your O
residency O
yeah O
you O
can O
work O
in O
some O
place O
in O
Spain B-LOC
too O
with O
l- O
%ah O

yeah O

yeah O
, O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
big O
draw O
for O
it O
right O
now O

if O
anything O
like O
I O
've O
always O
wanted O
to O
have O
like O
a O
bar O
or O
a O
restaurant O

I O
mean O
it O
takes O
tons O
of O
money O

yeah O

yeah O

me O
too O

well O

well O

But O
like O
I O
'd O
love O
to O

That O
's O
why O
I O
want O
to O
win O
the O
lottery O
first O
though O
Or O
to O
have O
enough O
background O
money O
to O
set O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
up O

but O
%um O
well O

yeah O

well O
%um O
good O

and O
so O
you O
're O
probably O
not O
going O
to O
come O
back O
Christmas B-MISC
which O
is O
cool O

Emory O
was O
telling O
me O
that O

so O

yeah O

and O
I O
probably O
wo O
n't O




Theoretically O
I O
'll O
be O
here O
. O

theoretically O
? O

yeah O
. O

You O
mean O
, O
do O
n't O
you O
well O
, O
you O
carry O
multiple O
calendars O
, O
so O
you O
never O
know O
? O

Well O
I O
do O
have O
two B-MISC
. O

One B-MISC
in O
the O
office O
and O
one B-MISC
at O
home O
. O

oh O

The B-MISC
weekend I-MISC
after I-MISC
that I-MISC
%uh O
I O
will O
not O
be O
in O
town O
. O

But O
, O
%um O
yeah O
, O

as O
I O
say O
, O
theoretically O
I O
'm O
here O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
decided O
whether O
I O
'm O
doing O
this O
yet O
. O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
silly O
, O
you O
know O
? O

I O
was O
just O
there O
. O

But O
I O
've O
been O
, O
%um O
, O

the O
next O
weekend O
again O
I O
'm O
invited O
for O
the O

let O
's O
see O

the O
child O
of O
my O
favorite O
cousin O
is O
being O
baptized O
, O

and O
they O
want O
me O
to O
be O
the O
godmother O

%mm O
. O

English B-MISC
. O

Patentante O
, O
ja O
. O

Yes O
, O

And O
, O
so O
, O
since O
I O
did O
n't O
go O
to O
their O
wedding O
, O
I O
-- O
feeling O
this O
big O
pressure O
. O

I O
should O
have O
just O
gone O
to O
the O
wedding O
last B-MISC
year I-MISC
. O

It O
was O
, O
like O
oh O
yeah O
. O
in O

They O
started O
asking O
me O
when O
I O
was O
on O
vacation O
already O
. O

And O
so O
I O
'm O
sort O
of O

it O
's O
easier O
to O
think O
about O
doing O
it O
when O
you O
're O
on O
vacation O
yeah O
. O
than O
if O
you O
get O
this O
idea O
%eh O
when O
you O
're O
at O
work O
and O
say O
, O
oh O
I O
ca O
n't O
go O
in O
four B-MISC
weeks I-MISC
. O

How O
could O
I O
possibly O
just O
do O
that O
? O

yeah O
I O
know O
the O
feeling O
. O

I O
m- O

But O
once O
you O
're O
in O
vacation O
mode O
, O
it O
's O
sort O
of O
like O
well O
why O
should O
n't O
I O
? O

I O
have O
the O
vacation O
, O

it O
's O
just O
you O
know O
, O
the O
time O
, O
and O
the O
money O
, O

and O
what O
is O
money O
for O

yeah O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
I O
have O
to O
make O
up O

It O
's O
a O
debate O
. O

You O
sound O
like O
you O
're O
the O
bank O
. O

No O
. O

But O
I O
have O
to O
make O
up O
my O
mind O
here O
by O
Friday B-MISC
because O
that O
's O
when O
I O
can O
hold O
my O
ticket O
too O
. O

So O
I O
thought O
I O
could O
get O
a O
ticket O
. O

I O
just O
have O
to O
have O
a O
discussion O
with O
my O
boss O
. O

So O
you O
have O
to O
let O
me O
know O
what O
this O
entails O
as O
consequences O
for O
me O
? O

oh O
for O
, O

oh O
yes O
. O

oh O
there O
are O
good O
consequences O
, O
if O
you O
're O
willing O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
aside O
from O

so O
I O
have O
to O
be O
there O
on O
the B-MISC
twentieth I-MISC
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O

okay O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
I O
could O
n't O
go O
for O
you O
know O
, O
just O
, O
For O
the B-MISC
day I-MISC
. O
you O
know O
three B-MISC
days I-MISC
. O

So O
I O
had O
to O
go O
at B-MISC
least I-MISC
a I-MISC
week I-MISC
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
there O
was O
an O
advantage O
. O

It O
's O
because O
, O

and O
if O
you O
'd O
like O
to O
join O
me O
I O
'd O
love O
it O
, O

I O
was O
also O
invited O
to O
a O
wedding O
on O
the B-MISC
twelfth I-MISC
somewhere O
near O
Duesseldorf B-LOC
. O

Between O
Duesseldorf B-LOC
and O
Essen B-LOC
. O

Well O
that O
can O
only O
be O
Rathingen B-LOC
or O

No O
it O
's O
north O
of O
Rathingen B-LOC
, O

because O
I O
've O
seen O
a O
map O
. O

But O
it O
's O
in O
a O
small O
thing O
. O

oh O
Ketting B-LOC
? O

k- O

Ketwig B-LOC
. O

Ketwig B-LOC
, O
Ketwig B-LOC
. O

Yes O
. O

yeah O
, O

that O
's O
almost O
Duesseldorf B-LOC
. O

%uh O
, O
that O
's O
almost O
Essen B-LOC
. O

okay O
. O

Whichever O
. O

I O
suppose O
that O
's O
close O
. O



yeah O
, O

it O
's O
not O
far O
. O

Through O
the B-MISC
S I-MISC
- I-MISC
bahn I-MISC
here O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
like B-MISC
twenty I-MISC
minutes I-MISC
. O

Or O
something O
. O

And O
so O
, O
if O
I O
do O
it O
, O
I O
'd O
love O
to O
have O
you O
join O
me O
. O

It O
's O
a O
fancy O
wedding O
too O
. O

Does O
that O
mean O
I O
have O
to O
get O

Do O
I O
have O
to O
wear O
a O
tie O
? O

Yes O
. O

Sure O
. O

y- O

%um O

could O
be O
it O
's O
actually O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
this O
. O

This O
is O
a O
German B-MISC
friend O
that O
I O

he O
worked O
here O
at O
NASA B-ORG
for O
like B-MISC
two I-MISC
years I-MISC
and O
was O
in O
mhm O
our O
German B-MISC
conversation O
club O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
he O
's O
marrying O
a O
German B-MISC
woman O
. O

I O
mean O
he O
just O
went O
back O
a O
little O
while O
ago O
because O
his O

No O
he O
's O
an O
American B-MISC
, O

but O
he O
's O
marrying O
a O
German B-MISC
woman O
. O

oh O
, O
he O
's O
a O
German B-MISC
. O

He O
's O
German B-MISC
too O
. O

yeah O
. O

They O
're O
both O
German B-MISC
. O

So O
this O
is O
a O
real O
mhm O
. O
German B-MISC
wedding O
. O

But O

And O
so O
he O
was O
saying O
we O
should O
come O
from O
our O

and O
one B-MISC
other O
person O
from O
our O
group O
is O
going O
because O
we O
would O

he O
had O
n't O
gotten O
around O
to O
planning O
his O
vacation O
. O

So O
he O
's O
going O
to O
be O
there O
. O

So O
I O
thought O
well O
that O
's O
on O
the B-MISC
twelfth I-MISC
, O
and O
the O
other O
thing O
is O
on O
the B-MISC
twentieth I-MISC
, O
you O
know O
. O

Why O
not O
? O

And O
then O
in O
between O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
go O
down O
and O
586.14_588.20_A: O
see O
my O
relatives O
in O
Bonn B-LOC
. O

oh O
well O
the B-MISC
twentieth I-MISC
i- O
, O

I O
mean O
that O
could O
be O
a O
pro- O
, O
e- O

Well O
no O
not O
the O
twentieth B-MISC
. O

The B-MISC
twentieth I-MISC
is O

twelfth I-MISC
. O

see O
, O
%uh O
dinner O
dance O
. O
mit O
Abendgarderobe O
. O

But O
I O
thought O
you O
playing O
piano O
you O
must O
have O
that O
. O

Abendgarderobe O
. O

Does O
n't O
that O
mean O
like O
really O
fancy O
clothes O
? O

%uh O
, O
well O
. O

Ja O
, O
ja O
. O

Ball O
dresses O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
tuxedos O
and O
things O
. O

yeah O
, O
I O
know O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
believe O
it O

because O
I O
met O
, O

when O
I O
was O
there O
on O
the O
other O
trip O
, O
I O
had O
n't O
read O
the O
invitation O
before O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
was O
going O
. O

And O
so O
I O
had O
met O
, O
%uh O
, O
his O
name O
is O
Heiko B-PER
, O
for O
one O
day O
in O
Hamburg B-LOC
. O

We O
met O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
he O
mentioned O
that O
he O
was O
looking O
for O
his O
tuxedo O
. O

And O
I O
said O
you O
're O
going O
to O
get O
married O
in O
a O
tuxedo O
? O

He O
said O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
. O

That O
evening O
. O

I O
've O
never O
heard O
of O
such O
a O
thing O
. O

Quite O
a O
wedding O
. O

But O
so O
if O
you O
want O
to O
bow O
out O
. O

Pardon O
? O

I O
said O
if O
you O
really O
do O
n't O
like O
those O
things O
. O

Well O
. O

But O
you O
know O
. O
It O
's O
great O
meals O
. O

Really O
. O

Free O
food O
. O

Aside O
from O
, O
we O
can O
talk O
, O

and O
they O
should O
be O
nice O
people O
. O

It O
'll O
be O

and O
then O
I O
'll O
know O
one B-MISC
more O
person O
there O
. O

How O
old O
are O
they O
? O

oh O
. O

A O
little O
bit O
younger O
than O
us O
. O

oh O
, O
he O
's O
probably O

good O
question O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Maybe O
he O
's O
thirty B-MISC
- I-MISC
two I-MISC
? O

That O
's O
okay O
. O

As O
long O
as O
they O
're O
not O
twenty B-MISC
- I-MISC
one I-MISC
. O

oh O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
. O

No O
%uh O
, O
spring O
chicken O

This O
is O
Herr O
Doktor O
Heiko B-PER
Hecht I-PER
and O
Jessika B-PER
whatever O
her O
name O
is O
. O

ooh O
. O

They O
actually O
met O
in O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
. O
At O
I O
think O
the B-ORG
University I-ORG
&of I-ORG
Virginia I-ORG
, O
where O
he O
got O
his O
doctorate O
? O

Or O
, O
maybe O
it O
's O
not O
Virginia B-LOC
, O

but O
it O
's O
somewhere O
over O
there O
. O

mhm O
. O

Something O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

mhm O
%hm O
. O

yeah O
, O

so O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
're O
not O
really O
young O
. O

So O
I O
s- O
, O

their O
friends O
I O
presume O
are O
in O
the O
same O
age O
. O

I O
think O
there O
'll O
be O
a O
lot O
of O
family O
friends O
. O

I O
have O
a O
f- O

okay O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
'm O
sure O
. O

weddings O
are O
always O
family O
. O

and O
the O
way O
he O
was O
talking O
, O
it O
sounds O
like O
his O
wife O
's O
family O
is O
well O
- O
to O
- O
do O
or O
something O
. O

so O

yeah O

well O
if O
it O
, O
ye- O

Interesting O
people O
. O

If O
they O
're O
having O
a O
wedding O
with O
Abendgarderobe O
then O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
pretty O

that O
's O
what O
I O
thought O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
's O
what O
I O
thought O
. O

Up O
upscale O
. O

And O
that O
. O

So O
think O
about O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O
I O
'll O
let O
you O
think O
about O
that O
, O

and O
you O
can O
write O
me O
a O
note O
or O
give O
me O
a O
call O
. O

Because O
I O
know O
some O
people O
really O
hate O
weddings O
. O

But O
you O
're O
afraid O
to O
say O
no O
, O

or O
you O
have O
to O
think O
about O
it O
. O

But O
it O
's O
the B-MISC
twelfth I-MISC
. O

And O
otherwise O
, O
what O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
try O
to O
do O
is O
stay O
with O
you O
the O
twelfth B-MISC
and O
thirteenth B-MISC
. O
Because O
it O
's O
weekend O
. O

mhm O
. O



Like O
we O
could O
see O
each O
other O
. O

And O
then O
I O
'll O
go O
Monday B-MISC
-- O
down O
to O
Bonn B-LOC
, O
or O
wherever O
those O
relatives O
are O
because O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
my O
uncle O
in O
like B-MISC
three I-MISC
or I-MISC
four I-MISC
years I-MISC
, O
and O
he O
's O
just O
turning O
eighty B-MISC
and O
I O
like O
them O
a O
lot O

uh-huh O
. O

In O
Bad B-LOC
Muenstereifel I-LOC
? O

yeah O
, O

I O
'll O

guess O
it O
'll O
be O
summer B-MISC

so O
he O
'll O
be O
in O
Bad B-LOC
Munstereifel I-LOC
. O

mhm O

They O
've O
actually O
moved O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
live O
in O
Bonn B-LOC
now O
. O

They O
live O
in O
-- O
%um O
, O
Bad B-LOC
Neuena I-LOC
. O
Which O
is O
I O
guess O

Bad B-LOC
Neuena I-LOC
ja O
. O

yeah O
, O

just O
a O
little O
bit O
down O
. O

But O
I O
think O
they O
'll O
be O
in O
Munstereifel B-LOC
. O

And O
then O
my O
cousin O
, O
she O
still O
does O
live O
in O
Bonn B-LOC

so O
I O
'll O
get O
to O
see O
her O
. O

And O
then O
I O
'll O
zip O
off O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
Right O
. O
mhm O
mhm O
go O
to O
this O
wedding O
and O
see O
my O
favorite O
cousin O
. O

Do O
n't O
tell O
the O
other O
cousins O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

yeah O
. O

Because O
you O
see O
, O
when O
I O
was O
there O
before O
I O
could O
n't O
visit O
you O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
time O
visiting O
these O
other O
relatives O
in O
Bonn B-LOC
. O

you O
're O
so O
diplomatic O
about O
all O
of O
that O
, O
you O
know O

Well O
I O
mean O
if O
I O
was O
visiting O
you O
, O
it O
would O
be O
very O
hard O
not O
to O
visit O
them O
. O

but O
n- O

But O
the O
year O
before O
I O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
, O
%uh O
, O
tell O
on O
you O
, O
you O
know O
. O

I O
know O
you O
would O
n't O
tell O
. O

But O
the O
year O
before O
I O
did O
it O
. O

But O
that O
's O
because O
of O
we O
just O
stopped O
on O
the O
train O
and O
I O
had O
, O
you O
know O
, O
two B-MISC
hours I-MISC
. O

And O
we O
had O
our O
wild O
lunch O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
on O
again O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
's O

We O
, O
%uh O
, O
commiserated O
. O

Yes O
. O

That O
sounds O
like O
you O
have O
you O
know O
its O
positive O
end O
result O
, O
which O
is O
good O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
it O
's O
a O
change O
, O

that O
's O
for O
sure O
. O

It O
's O
a O
change O
. O

And O
it O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
, O
obviously O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
, O

%eh O
but O
you O
know O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
. O

I O
always O
have O
this O
feeling O
I O
'm O
just O
so O
terribly O
slow O
. O

I O
have O
this O
feeling O
I O
should O
always O
be O
doing O
these O
things O
much O
faster O
than O
I O
get O
them O
done O
. O

Well O
, O
so O
what O
if O
you O
're O
slow O
? O

You O
know O
, O
look O
at O
it O
the O
other O
way O
. O

yeah O

but O
I O
always O
keep O
%eh O
that O
I O
'm O
spending O
too O
much O
time O
, O
that O
I O
should O
be O
doing O
other O
things O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
just O
had O
this O
talk O
about O
somebody O
who O
was O
you O
know O
, O
confirming O
, O
you O
know O

and O
I O
know O
I O
'm O
too O
self O
critical O
. O

So O
. O
It O
's O
not O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Because O
I O
was O
complaining O
to O
them O
about O
my O
mother O

and O
they O
are O
this O
theory O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
what O
people O
do O
is O
a O
reflection O
of O
you O
. O

%huh O
. O

Because O
this O
woman O
had O
such O
a O
that O
people O
react O
to O
you O
as O
a O
reflection O
of O
you O
. O

And O
what O
I O
had O
mentioned O
about O
my O
mother O
bugging O
me O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
every O
time O
I O
see O
her O
or O
we O
even O
talk O
, O
she O
has O
to O
comment O
about O
my O
clothes O
, O
or O
what O
I O
'm O
wearing O
. O

and O
I O
was O
talking O
to O
this O
woman O
because O
she O
seemed O
to O
have O
such O
a O
good O
relationship O
with O
her O
mother O
. O

Like O
her O
mother O
treated O
her O
like O
a O
human O
being O
and O
not O
a O
kid O
. O

%hm O
yeah O

and O
so O
she O
said O
you O
know O
and O
she O
's O
just O
a O
reflection O
. O

You O
know O
your O
mother O
's O
being O
critical O
you O
know O
. O

Be O
you O
see O
that O
because O
you O
're O
critical O
to O
yourself O
too O
much O

Or O
you O
're O
filtering O
the O
information O
you O
get O
from O
your O
mother O

yeah O

but O
this O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

I O
mean O
%uh O
she O
's O
never O
let O
up O
on O
that O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
crazy O
. O
You O
know O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
I O
mean O

and O
I O
think O
no O
not O
the O
last O
time O
the O
last O
time O
on O
the O
phone O
I O
bugged O
her O
about O
something O
else O
that O
I O
been O
trying O
to O
not O
take O
anymore O

but O
then O
she O
cries O

but O
that O
does O
n't O
work O
with O
me O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

That O
's O
good O
. O

Then O
she O
says O
I O
'm O
being O
mean O
. O

and O
I O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
's O
crying O
. O

I O
'm O
pretty O
tough O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

speaking O
of O
crying O
, O
I O
have O
a O
colleague O
. O
An O
American B-MISC
girl O
, O
a O
dancer O
. O
mhm O
at O
a O
school O
in O
Cologne B-LOC
mhm O
Who O
somehow O
or O
other O
has O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
me O
. O

mhm O

and O
now O
that O
I O
'm O
, O
going O
back O
to O
Duesseldorf B-LOC
she O
's O
all O
going O
crazy O
. O
%um O
and O
thinks O
%eh O

she O
's O
%eh O
concluded O
that O
I O
'm O
abandoning O
her O
. O

oho O

But O
it O
is O

Being O
stalked O
here O
? O

Pardon O
? O

In O
America B-LOC
, O
we O
would O
say O
are O
you O
being O
stalked O
? O




Unbelievable O
. O

yeah O

things O
are O
g- O

%eh O
%eh O
thank O
God O

really O
very O
very O
happy O
. O

Very O
nice O
. O

great O

what O
's O
with O
you O
? O

%uh O
, O
let O
's O
see O
, O

well O
I O
'm O
still O
hanging O
out O
at O
Westinghouse B-ORG
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
have O
your O
hat O
. O

I O
wear O
your O
hat O
all O
the O
time O
. O

oh O
goo- O

I O
thought O
you O
know O
it O
's O
a O
good O
hat O
man O
. O

I O
sent O
that O
to O
you O
with O
all O
%uh O
good O
intents O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
appreciate O
it O
. O

I O
do O
. O

I O
wear O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

okay O
. O

%uh O
%uh O
I O
hope O
I O
have O
%um O
a O
picture O
of O
myself O
when O
I O
%uh O
had O
reserves O
. O
you O
know O
the O
other O
month O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

I O
took O
a O
picture O
%uh O
with O
me O

and O
I O
hope O
it O
comes O
out O
. O

I O
'll O
send O
it O
to O
you O
. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
. O

%um O

If O
it O
does O
n't O
I O
'll O
take O
another O
picture O
. O

Let O
's O
see O
%uh O

Go O
ahead O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
still O
working O
there O
you O
know O

and O
%uh O
I O
'm O
on O
a O
pretty O
good O
project O
. O

Right O
. O

a O
long O
term O
%uh O
next O
generation O
%uh O
fighter O
plane O
. O

Really O
? O

So O
that O
's O
%uh O
kind O
of O
good O
experience O
I O
guess O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
%uh O
Westinghouse B-ORG
supposedly O
is O
making O
a O
bid O
to O
buy O
the O
%uh O
C O
B O
S O
broadcasting O
network O
. O

I O
thought O
they O
bought O
them O
already O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
takes O
months O
to O
close O
a O
deal O

so O
there O
's O
-- O
%ah O
. O
-- O
lots O
of O
speculation O
-- O
Right O
. O
-- O
that O
they O
'll O
have O
to O
sell O
the O
%uh O
electronics O
division O
in O
order O
to O
do O
that O
. O

and O
what O
would O
happen O
with O
you O
? O

I O
guess O
we O
'd O
be O
sold O
to O
another O
company O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
too O
concerned O
about O
it O
though O

but O
it O
's O
a O
possibility O
. O

But O
you O
have O
a O
senior O
position O
there O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
suppose O
so O
. O

But O
, O
you O
know O
. O
They O
do O
n't O
really O
think O
of O
it O
that O
way O

they O
just O
look O
at O
the O
numbers O
how O
many O
people O
they O
want O
and O
how O
many O
people O
they O
have O
. O

It O
's O
just O
a O
business O
. O

Right O
. O

they O
just O
get O
rid O
of O
what O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
%uh O
that O
's O
still O
going O
pretty O
well O
. O

%huh O

nothing O
really O
new O
with O
the O
house O
or O
anything O

We O
've O
had O
some O
interesting O
incidents O
with O
wasps O
that O
have O
%uh O
been O
invading O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

they O
built O
a O
nest O
in O
my O
rafters O
of O
my O
house O
and O
busted O
through O
. O

But O
I O
told O
you O
about O
that O
, O
I O
think O
. O

I O
got O
a O
in O
the O
mail O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
that O

Well O
I O
wanted O
to O
ask O
you O
what O
's O
with O
the O
school O
? O

The O
schools O
are O
extremely O
expensive O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
broke O
basically O
doing O
that O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
%uh O
handle O
that O

Well O
a O
lot O
of O

anymore O
because O
of O
you O

all O
these O
objections O
and O
all O

they O
've O
stopped O
%uh O

it O
's O
true O

it O
's O
true O

it O

Israelis B-LOC
do O
n't O
eat O
that O
much O
meat O
anyway O

it O
's O
more O
we O
eat O
fruit O
vegetables O
an- O
yeah O
yeah O
stuff O

nobody O
really O
eats O
steaks O
anymore O

like O
I O
grew O
up O
on O
steaks O
all O
the O
time O
from O
Sam B-ORG
's I-ORG
Supermarket I-ORG
you O
know O
all O
the O

yeah O

from O
Sam O
's O
Supermark- O

uh-huh O

yeah O

jeez O
%uh O
the O
last O
time O

had O
a O
steak O
was O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
months O
ago O

we O
do O
n't O
even O
eat O
steaks O
anymore O

but O
duh O
%eh O
in O
America B-LOC
too O
they O
do O
n't O
eat O
as O
much O
do O
they O

%uh O
no O

because O
for O
heart O
the O
fat O
is O
supposed O
by O
very O
bad O

yes O



Hello O

oh O
yeah O

yeah O

you O
said O
people O
are O
not O

no O

the O
red O
meat O
is O
suffering O
I O
guess O

I O
noticed O
that O
last O
time O
I O
was O
home O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
eat O
any O
either O

so O

yeah O

I O
know O
it O
's O
not O
a O
good O
idea O

I O

but O
Canada O
does O
n't O
use O
that O
junk O

I O
mean O
and O
they O
tell O
us O
I O
think O
Europe B-LOC
wo O
n't O
buy O
from O
us O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
the O
hormones O
with O
stuff O
in O
it O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
know O

I O
know O

it O
's O
%uh O

but O
we O
're O
using O
it O
naturally O

Well O

so O
everything O
you O
kn- O

I O
tell O
you O
it O
breaks O
my O
heart O
when O
I O
see O
them O
following O
that O

they O
think O
everything O
is O
so O
wonderful O

if O
there O
's O
some O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
know O

they O
take O
the O
good O
and O
the O
bad O
all O
the O

and O
that O
's O
t- O

yeah O

oh O
it O
's O
pitiful O

that O
makes O
me O
very O
very O
sad O

you O
know O
oh O
it O
's O
%eh O

very O
sad O

and O
even O
the O
Russians B-MISC
they O
come O
over O

and O
I O
know O
I O
can O
see O
the O
attitude O
%ah O
well O
that O
of O
course O
they O
know O
for O
ins- O

he O
's O
working O
in O
a O
neighborhood O
association O
like O
on O
funds O

yeah O

yeah O

on O
grants O

he O
does O
a O
wonderful O
job O

and O
they O
help O
him O

oh O
I O
think O
he O
was O
n't O
working O
when O
Holly B-PER
was O
here O

I O
think O
he O
was O
n't O
working O

he O
was O
n't O
working O
over O
yeah O
oh O
that O
's O
good O
that O
he O
three B-MISC
and I-MISC
half I-MISC
years I-MISC

but O
this O
is O
parttime O

but O
it O
's O
very O
involving O

it O
's O
very O
exciting O

oh O
that O
's O
nice O

and O
I O
thought O
that O
the O
people O
line O
up O
to O
see O
him O

and O
it O
's O
about O
getting O
help O
with O
housing O
and O
food O
stamps O
and O
everything O

yeah O

and O
a O
lady O
said O
you O
know O
my O
husband O
died O
and O
old O
lady O

I O
said O
oh O
I O
'm O
sorry O

she O
says O
I O
really O
thought O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
that O
you O
do O
n't O
die O
you O
know O

and O
I O
knew O
that O
underlying O
it O
they O
really O
believe O
that O
because O
if O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O

yeah O

they O
know O
everyone O
dies O

but O
underneath O
they O
feel O
maybe O
you O
do O
n't O
die O
until O
you O
're O
very O
very O
old O

but O
they O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
so O
many O
people O
die O
in O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
because O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O

oh O
wow O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
they O
got O
that O
idea O
from O

yeah O

but O
you O
see O
how O
it O
is O

jeez O

so O
everybody O
has O
these O
wrong O
conceptions O

I O
know O

I O
know O
%eh O

%eh O
%uh O
it O
's O
%uh O
pitiful O

but O

oh O
well O

yeah O

I O
'm O
su- O

with O
all O

Rosh B-MISC

th- O

's O
right O

that O
's O
right O

and O
you O
know O
it O
's O
just O

so O
she O
misses O

well O
you O
know O
%uh O
you O

like O
New B-MISC
Year I-MISC

%uh O

everything O

closed O
and O
all O
in O
America B-LOC

you O

not O
Israel B-LOC
although O

very O
Jewish B-MISC
sec- O

I O
'm O
wi- O

but O
in O
Hudson B-LOC
oh O
we O
used O
to O
have O
to O
miss O
school O

that O
's O
right O

and O
the O
teachers O
used O
to O
give O
us O
tests O
on O
those O
days O
just O
to O
be O
mean O

and O
we O
used O
to O
miss O
the O
tests O
and O
everything O

and O

I O
know O

Passover B-MISC
time O
we O
used O
to O
be O
embarrassed O
bringing O
matzos O
to O
school O
and O
everything O

and O
here O
I O
mean O
You O
know O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
any O
of O
those O
feelings O
at O
all O
you O
know O

I O
know O

I O
know O

I O
know O

it O
's O
th- O

it O
's O
very O
different O

so O



I O
know O

is O
it O
something O
you O
know O
you O
remember O
Fred B-PER
Allen I-PER
and O
Irene O
? O

%uh O
they O
're O
just O

really O

I O
'm O
sorry O

but O
they O
're O
just O
names O
to O
me O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
them O

yeah O

oh O
because O
you O
were O
%ah O
you O
know O

yeah O

they O
had O
a O
farm O
when O
they O
were O
first O
married O
which O
was O
like O
nineteen B-MISC
forty I-MISC
eight I-MISC

yeah O
? O

and O
then O
they O
moved O
away O

hello O

%uh O
oh O

yeah O

I O
'm O
here O

yeah O

So O
I O
think O
I O
still O
got O
five B-MISC
or O
ten B-MISC
minutes I-MISC
here O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O

I O

Are O

Well O
keep O
talking O
until O
we O
hang O
up O

it O
's O
nice O
talking O
to O
you O

yeah O

yeah O

%um O

So O
what O
about O
the O
Allens B-PER
? O

then O
they O
moved O
away O
to O
Middletown B-LOC

he O
was O
in O
the O
girls O
' O

do O
you O
remember O
the O
girls O
' O
reformatory O
in O
Hudson B-LOC

yeah O

yeah O

%um O

It O
was O
right O
across O
the O
street O
from O
my O
Aunt O
Seal B-PER
's O
house O

oh O
she O
lived O
there O
? O

On O
Worth B-MISC
Avenue I-MISC
I O
th- O

She O
did O
on O
Wor- O

yeah O
like O
Bessie B-PER
lived O
on O
Worth B-MISC
Avenue I-MISC

yeah O

%um O

yeah O

%um O
well O
it O
was O
%um O
my O
Uncle O
Ralph B-PER
's O

it O
was O
my O
father O
's O
%eh O
you O
know O
half O
brother O

right O

right O

I O
remember O

yeah O

Mitnics O
the O
Mitnics O

yes O

yes O

Well O
what O
about O
the O
Allens B-PER

what O
was O
their O
connection O
to O
that O

Well O
so O
originally O
he O
had O
come O
back O
from O
the O
army O

they O
got O
married O

he O
graduated O
Cornell B-ORG
agricultural O

had O
to O
be O
a O
farmer O

so O
about O
maybe O
two B-MISC
three B-MISC
years I-MISC
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
many O
years O
they O
had O
a O
dairy O
farm O

and O
you O
know O
how O
rough O

they O
were O
slaves O

they O
could O
n't O
go O
anywhere O
do O
anything O

yeah O

they O
had O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
farm O
because O
it O
's O
a O
small O
you O
know O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
any O
of O
this O

yeah O

but O
that O
's O
a O
lot O
like O
you O

you O
're O
much O
younger O
than O
me O

I O
was O
born O
in O
fifty B-MISC

oh O
so O
you O
're O
much O

I O
'm O
born O
in O
nineteen B-MISC
thirty I-MISC
nine I-MISC

so O
you O
're O

in O
nineteen B-MISC
fifty I-MISC

yeah O

yeah O

there O
's O
a O
difference O

yeah O

Yes O

so O
they O
left O
maybe O
before O
you O
were O
born O

yes O

yeah O

could O
b- O

or O
just O
about O
the O
time O
you O
were O
born O
they O
left O
Hudson B-LOC

yeah O

not O
the- O

So O
then O
they O
went O
to O
Middletow- O

%um O
then O
he O
came O
%um O
for O
the O
girls O
' O
school O

he O
became O

since O
he O
did O
n't O
at O
farming O

could O
n't O
be O
managed O

yeah O

he O
became O

he O
had O
been O
a O
captain O
in O
the O
army O
over O
difficult O
troops O
yeah O
So O
that O
he O
got O
into O
the O
correctional O
facility O
business O

I O
mean O
he O
got O
a O
job O

the O
girls O
' O
training O
school O
there O
needed O
someone O

and O
he O
got O
into O
that O

And O
he O
remained O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life O

oh O

so O
after O
that O
they O
moved O
to O
Middletown B-LOC

and O
then O
they O
went O
to O
South B-LOC
Portright I-LOC
upstate O
near O
Onianta B-LOC

yeah O
yeah O
and O
how O
shall O
I O
say O
he O
rebuilt O
a O
boys O
' O
training O
school O

and O
it O
was O
so O
successful O
they O
named O
it O
after O
him O
now O

oh O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
any O
of O
this O

yeah O

the O
Fred B-PER
All- O

yeah O

he O
's O
very O
very O
%um O
prominent O
in O
that O
field O
in O
the O
correc- O

no O
no O

he O
did O
a O
wonderful O
job O

in O

he O
had O
the O
best O
average O
of O
rehabilitation O
in O
the O
country O
for O
that O
age O
oh O
is O
that O
nice O
which O
is O
not O
too O
great O

but O
he O
had O
the O
best O
average O
in O
the O
country O

yeah O

what O
's O
he O
doing O

Lenny B-PER

Gloria B-PER

no O
I O

Lenny B-PER
lived O
right O
in O
Hudson B-LOC
and O
his O

and O
all O

we O
grew O

used O
to O
work O
in O
our O

I O
saw O
an O
angel O
coming O
down O
out O
of O
heaven O
. O

The O
angel O
had O
the O
key O
to O
the O
bottomless O
pit O
. O

The O
angel O
also O
held O
a O
large O
chain O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

The O
angel O
grabbed O
the O
dragon O
, O
that O
old O
snake O
, O
also O
known O
as O
the O
devil O
or O
Satan O
. O

The O
angel O
tied O
the O
dragon O
with O
the O
chain O
for O
1000 O
years O
. O

Then O
the O
angel O
threw O
the O
dragon O
into O
the O
bottomless O
pit O
and O
closed O
it O
. O

The O
angel O
locked O
it O
over O
the O
dragon O
. O

The O
angel O
did O
this O
so O
that O
the O
dragon O
could O
not O
trick O
the O
people O
of O
the O
earth O
until O
the O
1000 O
years O
were O
ended O
. O

After O
1000 O
years O
the O
dragon O
must O
be O
made O
free O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O

Then O
I O
saw O
some O
thrones O
and O
people O
sitting O
on O
them O
. O

These O
were O
the O
ones O
who O
had O
been O
given O
the O
power O
to O
judge O
. O

And O
I O
saw O
the O
souls O
of O
those O
who O
had O
been O
killed O
because O
they O
were O
faithful O
to O
the O
truth O
of O
Jesus O
and O
the O
message O
from O
God O
. O

They O
did O
not O
worship O
the O
beast O
or O
its O
idol O
. O

They O
did O
not O
receive O
the O
mark O
of O
the O
beast O
on O
their O
foreheads O
or O
on O
their O
hands O
. O

They O
came O
back O
to O
life O
and O
ruled O
with O
Christ O
for O
1000 O
years O
. O

-LRB- O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
dead O
did O
not O
live O
again O
until O
the O
1000 O
years O
were O
ended O
. O
-RRB- O

This O
is O
the O
first O
resurrection O
. O

Great O
blessings O
belong O
to O
those O
who O
share O
in O
this O
first O
resurrection O
. O

They O
are O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
. O

The O
second O
death O
has O
no O
power O
over O
them O
. O

They O
will O
be O
priests O
for O
God O
and O
for O
Christ O
. O

They O
will O
rule O
with O
him O
for O
1000 O
years O
. O

When O
the O
1000 O
years O
are O
ended O
, O
Satan O
will O
be O
made O
free O
from O
his O
prison O
. O

He O
will O
go O
out O
to O
trick O
the O
nations O
in O
all O
the O
earth O
, O
the O
nations O
known O
as O
Gog O
and O
Magog O
. O

Satan O
will O
gather O
the O
people O
for O
battle O
. O

There O
will O
be O
more O
people O
than O
anyone O
can O
count O
, O
like O
sand O
on O
the O
seashore O
. O

I O
saw O
Satan O
's O
army O
march O
across O
the O
earth O
and O
gather O
around O
the O
camp O
of O
God O
's O
people O
and O
the O
city O
that O
God O
loves O
. O

But O
fire O
came O
down O
from O
heaven O
and O
destroyed O
Satan O
's O
army O
. O

And O
he O
-LRB- O
the O
one O
who O
tricked O
these O
people O
-RRB- O
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
lake O
of O
burning O
sulfur O
with O
the O
beast O
and O
the O
false O
prophet O
. O

There O
they O
would O
be O
tortured O
day O
and O
night O
forever O
and O
ever O
. O

Then O
I O
saw O
a O
large O
white O
throne O
. O

I O
saw O
the O
one O
who O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
throne O
. O

Earth O
and O
sky O
ran O
away O
from O
him O
and O
disappeared O
. O

And O
I O
saw O
those O
who O
had O
died O
, O
great O
and O
small O
, O
standing O
before O
the O
throne O
. O

Some O
books O
were O
opened O
. O

And O
another O
book O
was O
opened O
-- O
the O
book O
of O
life O
. O

The O
people O
were O
judged O
by O
what O
they O
had O
done O
, O
which O
is O
written O
in O
the O
books O
. O

The O
sea O
gave O
up O
the O
dead O
who O
were O
in O
it O
. O

Death O
and O
Hades O
gave O
up O
the O
dead O
who O
were O
in O
them O
. O

All O
these O
people O
were O
judged O
by O
what O
they O
had O
done O
. O

And O
Death O
and O
Hades O
were O
thrown O
into O
the O
lake O
of O
fire O
. O

This O
lake O
of O
fire O
is O
the O
second O
death O
. O

And O
anyone O
whose O
name O
was O
not O
found O
written O
in O
the O
book O
of O
life O
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
lake O
of O
fire O
. O




Then O
I O
saw O
another O
powerful O
angel O
coming O
down O
from O
heaven O
. O

The O
angel O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
cloud O
. O

He O
had O
a O
rainbow O
around O
his O
head O
. O

The O
angel O
's O
face O
was O
like O
the O
sun O
, O
and O
his O
legs O
were O
like O
poles O
of O
fire O
. O

The O
angel O
was O
holding O
a O
small O
scroll O
. O

The O
scroll O
was O
open O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

He O
put O
his O
right O
foot O
on O
the O
sea O
and O
his O
left O
foot O
on O
the O
land O
. O

He O
shouted O
loudly O
like O
the O
roaring O
of O
a O
lion O
. O

After O
he O
shouted O
, O
the O
voices O
of O
seven O
thunders O
spoke O
. O

The O
seven O
thunders O
spoke O
, O
and O
I O
started O
to O
write O
. O

But O
then O
I O
heard O
a O
voice O
from O
heaven O
that O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
write O
what O
the O
seven O
thunders O
said O
. O

Keep O
those O
things O
secret O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
angel O
I O
saw O
standing O
on O
the O
sea O
and O
on O
the O
land O
raised O
his O
right O
hand O
to O
heaven O
. O

The O
angel O
made O
a O
promise O
by O
the O
power O
of O
the O
one O
who O
lives O
forever O
and O
ever O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
made O
the O
skies O
and O
all O
that O
is O
in O
them O
. O

He O
made O
the O
earth O
and O
all O
that O
is O
in O
it O
, O
and O
he O
made O
the O
sea O
and O
all O
that O
is O
in O
it O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
, O
`` O
There O
will O
be O
no O
more O
waiting O
! O

In O
the O
days O
when O
the O
seventh O
angel O
is O
ready O
to O
blow O
his O
trumpet O
, O
God O
's O
secret O
plan O
will O
be O
completed O
-- O
the O
Good O
News O
that O
God O
told O
to O
his O
servants O
, O
the O
prophets O
. O
'' O

Then O
I O
heard O
the O
same O
voice O
from O
heaven O
again O
. O

It O
said O
to O
me O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
take O
the O
open O
scroll O
that O
is O
in O
the O
angel O
's O
hand O
. O

This O
is O
the O
angel O
who O
is O
standing O
on O
the O
sea O
and O
on O
the O
land O
. O
'' O

So O
I O
went O
to O
the O
angel O
and O
asked O
him O
to O
give O
me O
the O
little O
scroll O
. O

He O
said O
to O
me O
, O
`` O
Take O
the O
scroll O
and O
eat O
it O
. O

It O
will O
be O
sour O
in O
your O
stomach O
, O
but O
in O
your O
mouth O
it O
will O
be O
sweet O
like O
honey O
. O
'' O

So O
I O
took O
the O
little O
scroll O
from O
the O
angel O
's O
hand O
and O
ate O
it O
. O

In O
my O
mouth O
it O
tasted O
sweet O
like O
honey O
, O
but O
after O
I O
ate O
it O
, O
it O
was O
sour O
in O
my O
stomach O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
told O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
prophesy O
again O
about O
many O
races O
of O
people O
, O
many O
nations O
, O
languages O
, O
and O
rulers O
. O
'' O




The O
law O
gave O
us O
only O
an O
unclear O
picture O
of O
the O
good O
things O
coming O
in O
the O
future O
. O

The O
law O
is O
not O
a O
perfect O
picture O
of O
the O
real O
things O
. O

The O
law O
tells O
people O
to O
offer O
the O
same O
sacrifices O
every O
year O
. O

Those O
who O
come O
to O
worship O
God O
continue O
to O
offer O
those O
sacrifices O
. O

But O
the O
law O
can O
never O
make O
them O
perfect O
. O

If O
the O
law O
could O
make O
people O
perfect O
, O
those O
sacrifices O
would O
have O
already O
stopped O
. O

They O
would O
already O
be O
clean O
from O
their O
sins O
, O
and O
they O
would O
not O
still O
feel O
guilty O
. O

But O
that O
's O
not O
what O
happens O
. O

Their O
sacrifices O
make O
them O
remember O
their O
sins O
every O
year O
, O
because O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
for O
the O
blood O
of O
bulls O
and O
goats O
to O
take O
away O
sins O
. O

So O
when O
Christ O
came O
into O
the O
world O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
do O
n't O
want O
sacrifices O
and O
offerings O
, O
but O
you O
have O
prepared O
a O
body O
for O
me O
. O

You O
are O
not O
pleased O
with O
the O
sacrifices O
of O
animals O
killed O
and O
burned O
or O
with O
offerings O
to O
take O
away O
sins O
. O

Then O
I O
said O
, O
' O
Here O
I O
am O
, O
God O
. O

It O
is O
written O
about O
me O
in O
the O
book O
of O
the O
law O
. O

I O
have O
come O
to O
do O
what O
you O
want O
. O
' O
'' O

Christ O
first O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
do O
n't O
want O
sacrifices O
and O
offerings O
. O

You O
are O
not O
pleased O
with O
animals O
killed O
and O
burned O
or O
with O
sacrifices O
to O
take O
away O
sin O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
These O
are O
all O
sacrifices O
that O
the O
law O
commands O
. O
-RRB- O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Here O
I O
am O
, O
God O
. O

I O
have O
come O
to O
do O
what O
you O
want O
. O
'' O

So O
God O
ends O
that O
first O
system O
of O
sacrifices O
and O
starts O
his O
new O
way O
. O

Jesus O
Christ O
did O
the O
things O
God O
wanted O
him O
to O
do O
. O

And O
because O
of O
that O
, O
we O
are O
made O
holy O
through O
the O
sacrifice O
of O
Christ O
's O
body O
. O

Christ O
made O
that O
sacrifice O
one O
time O
-- O
enough O
for O
all O
time O
. O

Every O
day O
the O
priests O
stand O
and O
do O
their O
religious O
service O
. O

Again O
and O
again O
they O
offer O
the O
same O
sacrifices O
, O
which O
can O
never O
take O
away O
sins O
. O

But O
Christ O
offered O
only O
one O
sacrifice O
for O
sins O
, O
and O
that O
sacrifice O
is O
good O
for O
all O
time O
. O

Then O
he O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
right O
side O
of O
God O
. O

And O
now O
Christ O
waits O
there O
for O
his O
enemies O
to O
be O
put O
under O
his O
power O
. O

With O
one O
sacrifice O
Christ O
made O
his O
people O
perfect O
forever O
. O

They O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
are O
being O
made O
holy O
. O

The O
Holy O
Spirit O
also O
tells O
us O
about O
this O
. O

First O
he O
says O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
agreement O
I O
will O
make O
with O
my O
people O
in O
the O
future O
, O
says O
the O
Lord O
. O

I O
will O
put O
my O
laws O
in O
their O
hearts O
. O

I O
will O
write O
my O
laws O
in O
their O
minds O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
forget O
their O
sins O
and O
never O
again O
remember O
the O
evil O
they O
have O
done O
. O
'' O

And O
after O
everything O
is O
forgiven O
, O
there O
is O
no O
more O
need O
for O
a O
sacrifice O
to O
pay O
for O
sins O
. O

And O
so O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
we O
are O
completely O
free O
to O
enter O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
. O

We O
can O
do O
this O
without O
fear O
because O
of O
the O
blood O
sacrifice O
of O
Jesus O
. O

We O
enter O
through O
a O
new O
way O
that O
Jesus O
opened O
for O
us O
. O

It O
is O
a O
living O
way O
that O
leads O
through O
the O
curtain O
-- O
Christ O
's O
body O
. O

And O
we O
have O
a O
great O
priest O
who O
rules O
the O
house O
of O
God O
. O

Sprinkled O
with O
the O
blood O
of O
Christ O
, O
our O
hearts O
have O
been O
made O
free O
from O
a O
guilty O
conscience O
, O
and O
our O
bodies O
have O
been O
washed O
with O
pure O
water O
. O

So O
come O
near O
to O
God O
with O
a O
sincere O
heart O
, O
full O
of O
confidence O
because O
of O
our O
faith O
in O
Christ O
. O

We O
must O
hold O
on O
to O
the O
hope O
we O
have O
, O
never O
hesitating O
to O
tell O
people O
about O
it O
. O

We O
can O
trust O
God O
to O
do O
what O
he O
promised O
. O

We O
should O
think O
about O
each O
other O
to O
see O
how O
we O
can O
encourage O
each O
other O
to O
show O
love O
and O
do O
good O
works O
. O

We O
must O
not O
quit O
meeting O
together O
, O
as O
some O
are O
doing O
. O

No O
, O
we O
need O
to O
keep O
on O
encouraging O
each O
other O
. O

This O
becomes O
more O
and O
more O
important O
as O
you O
see O
the O
Day O
getting O
closer O
. O

If O
we O
decide O
to O
continue O
sinning O
after O
we O
have O
learned O
the O
truth O
, O
then O
there O
is O
no O
other O
sacrifice O
that O
will O
take O
away O
sins O
. O

If O
we O
continue O
sinning O
, O
all O
that O
is O
left O
for O
us O
is O
a O
fearful O
time O
of O
waiting O
for O
the O
judgment O
and O
the O
angry O
fire O
that O
will O
destroy O
those O
who O
live O
against O
God O
. O

Whoever O
refused O
to O
obey O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
was O
found O
guilty O
from O
the O
testimony O
given O
by O
two O
or O
three O
witnesses O
. O

Such O
people O
were O
not O
forgiven O
. O

They O
were O
killed O
. O

So O
think O
how O
much O
more O
punishment O
people O
deserve O
who O
show O
their O
hate O
for O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
-- O
people O
who O
show O
they O
have O
no O
respect O
for O
the O
blood O
sacrifice O
that O
began O
the O
new O
agreement O
and O
once O
made O
them O
holy O
or O
who O
insult O
the O
Spirit O
of O
God O
's O
grace O
. O

We O
know O
that O
God O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
punish O
people O
for O
the O
wrongs O
they O
do O
; O
I O
will O
repay O
them O
. O
'' O

And O
he O
also O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
will O
judge O
his O
people O
. O
'' O

It O
is O
a O
terrible O
thing O
to O
face O
punishment O
from O
the O
living O
God O
. O

Remember O
the O
days O
when O
you O
first O
learned O
the O
truth O
. O

You O
had O
a O
hard O
struggle O
with O
much O
suffering O
, O
but O
you O
continued O
strong O
. O

Sometimes O
people O
said O
hateful O
things O
to O
you O
and O
mistreated O
you O
in O
public O
. O

And O
sometimes O
you O
helped O
others O
who O
were O
being O
treated O
that O
same O
way O
. O

Yes O
, O
you O
helped O
them O
in O
prison O
and O
shared O
in O
their O
suffering O
. O

And O
you O
were O
still O
happy O
when O
everything O
you O
owned O
was O
taken O
away O
from O
you O
. O

You O
continued O
to O
be O
happy O
, O
because O
you O
knew O
that O
you O
had O
something O
much O
better O
-- O
something O
that O
would O
continue O
forever O

So O
do O
n't O
lose O
the O
courage O
that O
you O
had O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Your O
courage O
will O
be O
rewarded O
richly O
. O

You O
must O
be O
patient O
. O

After O
you O
have O
done O
what O
God O
wants O
, O
you O
will O
get O
what O
he O
promised O
you O
. O

He O
says O
, O
`` O
Very O
soon O
now O
, O
the O
one O
who O
is O
coming O
will O
come O
and O
will O
not O

The O
person O
who O
is O
right O
with O
me O
will O
live O
by O
trusting O
in O
me O
. O

But O
I O
will O
not O
be O
pleased O
with O
the O
one O
who O
turns O
back O
in O
fear O

'' O

But O
we O
are O
not O
those O
who O
turn O
back O
and O
are O
lost O

No O

we O
are O
the O

One O
day O
Jesus O
was O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
teaching O
the O
people O
. O

He O
was O
telling O
them O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
, O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
, O
and O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
came O
to O
talk O
to O
Jesus O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Tell O
us O
what O
authority O
you O
have O
to O
do O
these O
things O
. O

Who O
gave O
you O
this O
authority O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
ask O
you O
a O
question O
too O
. O

Tell O
me O
: O
When O
John O
baptized O
people O
, O
did O
his O
authority O
come O
from O
God O
or O
was O
it O
only O
from O
other O
people O
? O
'' O

The O
priests O
, O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
, O
and O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
all O
talked O
about O
this O
. O

They O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
If O
we O
answer O
, O
' O
John O
's O
baptism O
was O
from O
God O
, O
' O
then O
he O
will O
say O
, O
' O
Then O
why O
did O
you O
not O
believe O
John O
? O
' O

But O
if O
we O
say O
that O
John O
's O
baptism O
was O
from O
someone O
else O
, O
the O
people O
will O
stone O
us O
to O
death O
. O

They O
all O
believe O
that O
John O
was O
a O
prophet O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
answer O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Then O
I O
will O
not O
tell O
you O
who O
gave O
me O
the O
authority O
to O
do O
these O
things O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
told O
the O
people O
this O
story O
: O
`` O
A O
man O
planted O
a O
vineyard O
. O

He O
leased O
the O
land O
to O
some O
farmers O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
away O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Later O
, O
it O
was O
time O
for O
the O
grapes O
to O
be O
picked O
. O

So O
the O
man O
sent O
a O
servant O
to O
those O
farmers O
so O
that O
they O
would O
give O
him O
his O
share O
of O
the O
grapes O
. O

But O
they O
beat O
the O
servant O
and O
sent O
him O
away O
with O
nothing O
. O

So O
the O
man O
sent O
another O
servant O
. O

They O
beat O
this O
servant O
too O
and O
showed O
no O
respect O
for O
him O
. O

They O
sent O
the O
servant O
away O
with O
nothing O
. O

So O
the O
man O
sent O
a O
third O
servant O
to O
the O
farmers O
. O

They O
hurt O
this O
servant O
badly O
and O
threw O
him O
out O
. O

`` O
The O
owner O
of O
the O
vineyard O
said O
, O
' O
What O
will O
I O
do O
now O
? O

I O
will O
send O
my O
son O
. O

I O
love O
my O
son O
very O
much O
. O

Maybe O
the O
farmers O
will O
respect O
my O
son O
. O
' O

When O
the O
farmers O
saw O
the O
son O
, O
they O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
' O
This O
is O
the O
owner O
's O
son O
. O

This O
vineyard O
will O
be O
his O
. O

If O
we O
kill O
him O
, O
it O
will O
be O
ours O
. O
' O

So O
the O
farmers O
threw O
the O
son O
out O
of O
the O
vineyard O
and O
killed O
him O
. O

`` O
What O
will O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
vineyard O
do O
? O

He O
will O
come O
and O
kill O
those O
farmers O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
lease O
the O
land O
to O
some O
other O
farmers O

'' O

When O
the O
people O
heard O
this O
story O
, O
they O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
should O
never O
happen O
! O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
looked O
into O
their O
eyes O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Then O
what O
does O
this O
verse O
mean O
: O
' O
The O
stone O
that O
the O
builders O
refused O
to O
accept O
became O
the O
cornerstone O

Everyone O
who O
falls O
on O
that O

be O
broken O

If O
that O
stone O
falls O
on O
you O

it O
will O
crush O
you O

When O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
and O
the O
leading O
priests O
heard O
this O
story O
, O
they O
knew O
it O
was O
about O
them O
. O

So O
they O
wanted O
to O
arrest O
Jesus O
right O
then O
, O
but O
they O
were O
afraid O
of O
what O
the O
people O
would O
do O
. O

So O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
waited O
for O
the O
right O
time O
to O
get O
Jesus O
. O

They O
sent O
some O
men O
to O
him O
, O
who O
pretended O
to O
be O
sincere O

They O
wanted O
to O
find O
something O
wrong O
with O
what O
Jesus O
said O
. O

-LRB- O
If O
they O
found O
something O
wrong O
, O
then O
they O
could O
hand O
him O
over O
to O
the O
governor O
, O
who O
had O
the O
authority O
to O
arrest O
him O
. O
-RRB- O

So O
the O
men O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
we O
know O
that O
what O
you O
say O
and O
teach O
is O
true O

It O

who O
is O

you O
teach O
the O
same O
to O
all O
people O

You O
always O
teach O
the O
truth O
about O
God O

way O

Tell O
us O
, O
is O
it O
right O
for O
us O
to O
pay O
taxes O
to O
Caesar O
or O
not O
? O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
knew O
that O
these O
men O
were O
trying O
to O
trick O
him O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Show O
me O
a O
silver O
coin O

Whose O
name O

picture O
are O
on O

They O
said O
, O
`` O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Then O
give O

'' O

The O
men O
were O
amazed O
at O
his O
wise O
answer O
. O

They O
could O
say O
nothing O
. O

They O
were O
not O
able O
to O
trick O
Jesus O
there O
in O
front O
of O
the O
people O
. O

He O
said O
nothing O
they O
could O
use O
against O
him O
. O



Some O
Sadducees O
came O
to O
Jesus O
. O

-LRB- O
Sadducees O
believe O
that O
people O
will O
not O
rise O
from O
death O
. O
-RRB- O

They O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
Moses O
wrote O
that O
if O
a O
married O
man O
dies O
and O
had O
no O
children O

his O
brother O
must O
marry O
his O
widow O

Then O
they O
will O
have O
children O
for O
the O
dead O
brother O
. O

One O
time O
there O
were O
seven O
brothers O
. O

The O
first O
brother O
married O
a O
woman O
but O
died O
. O

He O
had O
no O
children O

Then O
the O
second O
brother O
married O
the O

he O
died O

And O
the O
third O

married O

he O

The O

thing O
happened O
with O
all O
the O
other O
brothers O

They O
all O
died O
and O
had O
no O
children O

The O
woman O
was O
the O
last O
to O
die O
. O

But O
all O
seven O
brothers O
married O
her O
. O

So O
when O
people O
rise O
from O
death O
, O
whose O
wife O
will O
this O
woman O
be O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
Sadducees O
, O
`` O
On O
earth O
, O
people O
marry O
each O
other O

Some O
people O
will O
be O
worthy O
to O
be O
raised O
from O
death O

live O
again O
after O
this O
life O

In O
that O
life O
they O
will O
not O

In O
that O
life O
people O
are O
like O
angels O

can O
not O
die O

They O
are O
children O
of O
God O

because O
they O
have O
been O
raised O
from O

Moses O
clearly O
showed O
that O
people O
are O
raised O
from O
death O

When O
Moses O
wrote O
about O
the O
burning O
bush O
, O
he O
said O
that O
the O
Lord O

the O
God O
of O
Abraham O

the O
God O
of O
Isaac O
, O
and O
the O
God O
of O
Jacob O

' O

So O
they O
were O
not O
still O
dead O
, O
because O
he O
is O
the O
God O
only O
of O
living O
people O

Yes O
, O
to O
God O
they O
are O
all O
still O
living O

'' O

Some O
of O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
your O
answer O
was O
very O
good O

No O
one O
was O
brave O
enough O
to O
ask O
him O
another O
question O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
people O
say O
that O
the O
Christ O
is O
the O
Son O
of O
David O
? O

In O
the O
book O
of O
Psalms O
, O
David O
himself O
says O
, O
' O
The O
Lord O
God O
said O
to O

and O
I O
will O
put O
your O
enemies O
under O
your O
power O

' O

David O
calls O
the O
Christ O
' O
Lord O
. O
' O

So O
how O
can O
the O
Christ O
also O
be O
David O
's O
son O
? O
'' O

While O
all O
the O
people O
were O
listening O
to O
Jesus O
, O
he O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Be O
careful O
of O
the O

They O

And O
they O
love O

They O
love O

the O
most O
important O
seats O
in O
the O
synagogues O

the O
places O
of O
honor O
at O
banquets O

But O
they O
cheat O
widows O
and O
take O
their O
homes O

Then O
they O
try O
to O
make O
themselves O
look O
good O
by O
saying O
long O
prayers O

God O
will O
punish O
them O
very O
much O

After O
this O
, O
the O
Lord O
chose O
72 O
more O
followers O

He O
sent O
them O
out O
in O
groups O

He O

him O

he O

not O
because O
you O
have O
this O
power O
, O
but O
because O
your O
names O
are O
written O
in O
heaven O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
made O
Jesus O
feel O
very O
happy O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
praise O
you O
, O
Father O
, O
Lord O
of O
heaven O
and O
earth O
. O

I O
am O
thankful O
that O
you O
have O
hidden O
these O
things O
from O
those O
who O
are O
so O
wise O
and O
so O
smart O
. O

But O
you O
have O
shown O
them O
to O
people O
who O
are O
like O
little O
children O
. O

Yes O
, O
Father O
, O
you O
did O
this O
because O
it O
's O
what O
you O
really O
wanted O
to O
do O
. O

`` O
My O
Father O
has O
given O
me O
all O
things O
. O

No O
one O
knows O
who O
the O
Son O
is O
-- O
only O
the O
Father O
knows O
. O

And O
only O
the O
Son O
knows O
who O
the O
Father O
is O
. O

The O
only O
people O
who O
will O
know O
about O
the O
Father O
are O
those O
the O
Son O
chooses O
to O
tell O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
turned O
to O
his O
followers O
. O

They O
were O
there O
alone O
with O
him O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
a O
great O
blessing O
for O
you O
to O
see O
what O
you O
now O
see O
! O

I O
tell O
you O
, O
many O
prophets O
and O
kings O
wanted O
to O
see O
what O
you O
now O
see O
, O
but O
they O
could O
not O
. O

And O
they O
wanted O
to O
hear O
what O
you O
now O
hear O
, O
but O
they O
could O
not O
. O
'' O

Then O
an O
expert O
in O
the O
law O
stood O
up O
to O
test O
Jesus O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
what O
must O
I O
do O
to O
get O
eternal O
life O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
What O
is O
written O
in O
the O
law O
? O

What O
do O
you O
understand O
from O
it O
? O
'' O

The O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
' O
Love O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
, O
all O
your O
soul O
, O
all O
your O
strength O
, O
and O
all O
your O
mind O
. O
' O

Also O
, O
' O
Love O
your O
neighbor O
the O
same O
as O
you O
love O
yourself O
. O
' O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Your O
answer O
is O
right O
. O

Do O
this O
and O
you O
will O
have O
eternal O
life O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
man O
wanted O
to O
show O
that O
the O
way O
he O
was O
living O
was O
right O
. O

So O
he O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
But O
who O
is O
my O
neighbor O
? O
'' O



To O
answer O
this O
question O
, O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
A O
man O
was O
going O
down O
the O
road O
from O
Jerusalem O
to O
Jericho O
. O

Some O
robbers O
surrounded O
him O
, O
tore O
off O
his O
clothes O
, O
and O
beat O
him O
. O

Then O
they O
left O
him O
lying O
there O
on O
the O
ground O
almost O
dead O
. O

`` O
It O
happened O
that O
a O
Jewish O
priest O
was O
going O
down O
that O
road O
. O

When O
he O
saw O
the O
man O
, O
he O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
help O
him O
. O

He O
walked O
away O
. O

Next O
, O
a O
Levite O
came O
near O
. O

He O
saw O
the O
hurt O
man O
, O
but O
he O
went O
around O
him O
. O

He O
would O
not O
stop O
to O
help O
him O
either O
. O

He O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

`` O
Then O
a O
Samaritan O
man O
traveled O
down O
that O
road O
. O

He O
came O
to O
the O
place O
where O
the O
hurt O
man O
was O
lying O
. O

He O
saw O
the O
man O
and O
felt O
very O
sorry O
for O
him O
. O

The O
Samaritan O
went O
to O
him O
and O
poured O
olive O
oil O
and O
wine O
on O
his O
wounds O
. O

Then O
he O
covered O
the O
man O
's O
wounds O
with O
cloth O
. O

The O
Samaritan O
had O
a O
donkey O
. O

He O
put O
the O
hurt O
man O
on O
his O
donkey O
, O
and O
he O
took O
him O
to O
an O
inn O
. O

There O
he O
cared O
for O
him O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
the O
Samaritan O
took O
out O
two O
silver O
coins O
and O
gave O
them O
to O
the O
man O
who O
worked O
at O
the O
inn O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
Take O
care O
of O
this O
hurt O
man O
. O

If O
you O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
him O
, O
I O
will O
pay O
it O
back O
to O
you O
when O
I O
come O
again O
. O
' O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Which O
one O
of O
these O
three O
men O
do O
you O
think O
was O
really O
a O
neighbor O
to O
the O
man O
who O
was O
hurt O
by O
the O
robbers O
? O
'' O

The O
teacher O
of O
the O
law O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
one O
who O
helped O
him O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Then O
you O
go O
and O
do O
the O
same O
. O
'' O

While O
Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
were O
traveling O
, O
he O
went O
into O
a O
town O
, O
and O
a O
woman O
named O
Martha O
let O
him O
stay O
at O
her O
house O
. O

She O
had O
a O
sister O
named O
Mary O
. O

Mary O
was O
sitting O
at O
Jesus O
' O
feet O
and O
listening O
to O
him O
teach O
. O

But O
her O
sister O
Martha O
was O
busy O
doing O
all O
the O
work O
that O
had O
to O
be O
done O
. O

Martha O
went O
in O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
do O
n't O
you O
care O
that O
my O
sister O
has O
left O
me O
to O
do O
all O
the O
work O
by O
myself O
? O

Tell O
her O
to O
help O
me O
! O
'' O

But O
the O
Lord O
answered O
her O
, O
`` O
Martha O
, O
Martha O
, O
you O
are O
getting O
worried O
and O
upset O
about O
too O
many O
things O
. O

Only O
one O
thing O
is O
important O
. O

Mary O
has O
made O
the O
right O
choice O
, O
and O
it O
will O
never O
be O
taken O
away O
from O
her O
. O
'' O




Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
what O
I O
want O
most O
is O
for O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
to O
be O
saved O
. O

That O
is O
my O
prayer O
to O
God O
. O

I O
can O
say O
this O
about O
them O
: O
They O
really O
try O
hard O
to O
follow O
God O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
right O
way O
. O

They O
did O
not O
know O
the O
way O
that O
God O
makes O
people O
right O
with O
him O
. O

And O
they O
tried O
to O
make O
themselves O
right O
in O
their O
own O
way O
. O

So O
they O
did O
not O
accept O
God O
's O
way O
of O
making O
people O
right O
. O

Christ O
ended O
the O
law O
so O
that O
everyone O
who O
believes O
in O
him O
is O
made O
right O
with O
God O
. O

Moses O
writes O
about O
being O
made O
right O
by O
following O
the O
law O
. O

He O
says O
, O
`` O
The O
person O
who O
obeys O
these O
laws O
is O
the O
one O
who O
will O
have O
life O
through O
them O
. O
'' O

But O
this O
is O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
about O
being O
made O
right O
through O
faith O
: O
`` O
Do O
n't O
say O
to O
yourself O
, O
' O
Who O
will O
go O
up O
into O
heaven O
? O
' O
'' O

-LRB- O
This O
means O
`` O
Who O
will O
go O
up O
to O
heaven O
to O
get O
Christ O
and O
bring O
him O
down O
to O
earth O
? O
'' O

-RRB- O
`` O
And O
do O
n't O
say O
, O
' O
Who O
will O
go O
down O
into O
the O
world O
below O
? O
' O
'' O

-LRB- O
This O
means O
`` O
Who O
will O
go O
down O
to O
get O
Christ O
and O
bring O
him O
up O
from O
death O
? O
'' O

-RRB- O
This O
is O
what O
the O
Scripture O
says O
: O
`` O
God O
's O
teaching O
is O
near O
you O
; O
it O
is O
in O
your O
mouth O
and O
in O
your O
heart O
. O
'' O

It O
is O
the O
teaching O
of O
faith O
that O
we O
tell O
people O
. O

If O
you O
openly O
say O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
is O
Lord O
'' O
and O
believe O
in O
your O
heart O
that O
God O
raised O
him O
from O
death O
, O
you O
will O
be O
saved O
. O

Yes O
, O
we O
believe O
in O
Jesus O
deep O
in O
our O
hearts O
, O
and O
so O
we O
are O
made O
right O
with O
God O
. O

And O
we O
openly O
say O
that O
we O
believe O
in O
him O
, O
and O
so O
we O
are O
saved O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Anyone O
who O
trusts O
in O
him O
will O
never O
be O
disappointed O
. O
'' O

It O
says O
this O
because O
there O
is O
no O
difference O
between O
those O
who O
are O
Jews O
and O
those O
who O
are O
not O
. O

The O
same O
Lord O
is O
the O
Lord O
of O
all O
people O
. O

And O
he O
richly O
blesses O
everyone O
who O
looks O
to O
him O
for O
help O
. O

Yes O
, O
`` O
everyone O
who O
trusts O
in O
the O
Lord O
will O
be O
saved O
. O
'' O

But O
before O
people O
can O
pray O
to O
the O
Lord O
for O
help O
, O
they O
must O
believe O
in O
him O
. O

And O
before O
they O
can O
believe O
in O
the O
Lord O
, O
they O
must O
hear O
about O
him O
. O

And O
for O
anyone O
to O
hear O
about O
the O
Lord O
, O
someone O
must O
tell O
them O
. O

And O
before O
anyone O
can O
go O
and O
tell O
them O
, O
they O
must O
be O
sent O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
How O
wonderful O
it O
is O
to O
see O
someone O
coming O
to O
tell O
good O
news O
! O
'' O

But O
not O
all O
the O
people O
accepted O
that O
good O
news O
. O

Isaiah O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
who O
believed O
what O
we O
told O
them O
? O
'' O

So O
faith O
comes O
from O
hearing O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

And O
people O
hear O
the O
Good O
News O
when O
someone O
tells O
them O
about O
Christ O
. O

But O
I O
ask O
, O
`` O
Did O
those O
people O
not O
hear O
the O
Good O
News O
? O
'' O

Yes O
, O
they O
heard O
-- O
as O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Their O
voices O
went O
out O
all O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Their O
words O
went O
everywhere O
in O
the O
world O
. O
'' O

Again O
I O
ask O
, O
`` O
Did O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
not O
understand O
? O
'' O

Yes O
, O
they O
did O
understand O
. O

First O
, O
Moses O
says O
this O
for O
God O
: O
`` O
I O
will O
use O
those O
who O
are O
not O
really O
a O
nation O
to O
make O
you O
jealous O
. O

I O
will O
use O
a O
nation O
that O
does O
not O
understand O
to O
make O
you O
angry O
. O
'' O

Then O
Isaiah O
is O
bold O
enough O
to O
say O
this O
for O
God O
: O
`` O
The O
people O
who O
were O
not O
looking O
for O
me O
-- O
they O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
found O
me O
. O

I O
made O
myself O
known O
to O
those O
who O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
me O
. O
'' O

But O
about O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
God O
says O
, O
`` O
All O
day O
long O
I O
stood O
ready O
to O
accept O
those O
people O
, O
but O
they O
are O
stubborn O
and O
refuse O
to O
obey O
me O
. O
'' O




When O
the O
trouble O
stopped O
, O
Paul O
invited O
the O
Lord O
's O
followers O
to O
come O
visit O
him O
. O

After O
encouraging O
them O
, O
he O
told O
them O
goodbye O
and O
left O
for O
Macedonia O
. O

On O
his O
way O
through O
Macedonia O
he O
had O
many O
words O
of O
encouragement O
for O
the O
followers O
in O
various O
places O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
to O
Greece O
and O
stayed O
there O
three O
months O
. O

Paul O
was O
ready O
to O
sail O
for O
Syria O
, O
but O
some O
Jews O
were O
planning O
something O
against O
him O
. O

So O
he O
decided O
to O
go O
back O
through O
Macedonia O
to O
Syria O
. O

These O
men O
were O
traveling O
with O
him O
: O
Sopater O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Pyrrhus O
, O
from O
the O
city O
of O
Berea O
; O
Aristarchus O
and O
Secundus O
, O
from O
the O
city O
of O
Thessalonica O
; O
Gaius O
, O
from O
the O
city O
of O
Derbe O
; O
Timothy O
; O
and O
two O
men O
from O
Asia O
, O
Tychicus O
and O
Trophimus O
. O

These O
men O
went O
first O
, O
ahead O
of O
Paul O
. O

They O
waited O
for O
us O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Troas O
. O

We O
sailed O
from O
the O
city O
of O
Philippi O
after O
the O
Festival O
of O
Unleavened O
Bread O
. O

We O
met O
these O
men O
in O
Troas O
five O
days O
later O
and O
stayed O
there O
seven O
days O
. O

On O
Sunday O
we O
all O
met O
together O
to O
eat O
the O
Lord O
's O
Supper O
. O

Paul O
talked O
to O
the O
group O
. O

Because O
he O
was O
planning O
to O
leave O
the O
next O
day O
, O
he O
continued O
talking O
until O
midnight O
. O

We O
were O
all O
together O
in O
a O
room O
upstairs O
, O
and O
there O
were O
many O
lights O
in O
the O
room O
. O

There O
was O
a O
young O
man O
named O
Eutychus O
sitting O
in O
the O
window O
. O

Paul O
continued O
talking O
, O
and O
Eutychus O
became O
very O
, O
very O
sleepy O
. O

Finally O
, O
he O
went O
to O
sleep O
and O
fell O
out O
of O
the O
window O
. O

He O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
from O
the O
third O
floor O
. O

When O
the O
people O
went O
down O
and O
lifted O
him O
up O
, O
he O
was O
dead O
. O

Paul O
went O
down O
to O
where O
Eutychus O
was O
, O
knelt O
down O
beside O
him O
, O
and O
put O
his O
arms O
around O
him O
. O

He O
said O
to O
the O
other O
believers O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
worry O
. O

He O
is O
alive O
now O
. O
'' O

Then O
Paul O
went O
upstairs O
again O
, O
broke O
off O
some O
pieces O
of O
bread O
and O
ate O
. O

He O
spoke O
to O
them O
a O
long O
time O
. O

It O
was O
early O
morning O
when O
he O
finished O
, O
and O
then O
he O
left O
. O

The O
Lord O
's O
followers O
took O
Eutychus O
home O
alive O
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
greatly O
comforted O
. O

We O
went O
on O
ahead O
of O
Paul O
and O
sailed O
for O
the O
city O
of O
Assos O
, O
planning O
to O
meet O
him O
there O
. O

This O
is O
what O
he O
told O
us O
to O
do O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
go O
by O
land O
. O

When O
he O
caught O
up O
with O
us O
at O
Assos O
, O
we O
took O
him O
on O
board O
, O
and O
we O
all O
sailed O
to O
Mitylene O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
we O
sailed O
away O
from O
there O
and O
came O
to O
a O
place O
near O
the O
island O
of O
Chios O
. O

Then O
the O
next O
day O
, O
we O
sailed O
to O
the O
island O
of O
Samos O
. O

A O
day O
later O
, O
we O
came O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Miletus O
. O

Paul O
had O
already O
decided O
not O
to O
stop O
at O
Ephesus O
. O

He O
did O
not O
want O
to O
stay O
too O
long O
in O
Asia O
. O

He O
was O
hurrying O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
be O
in O
Jerusalem O
on O
the O
day O
of O
Pentecost O
if O
possible O
. O

In O
Miletus O
Paul O
sent O
a O
message O
back O
to O
Ephesus O
, O
telling O
the O
elders O
of O
the O
church O
in O
Ephesus O
to O
come O
to O
him O
. O

When O
they O
came O
, O
Paul O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
know O
about O
my O
life O
from O
the O
first O
day O
I O
came O
to O
Asia O
. O

You O
know O
the O
way O
I O
lived O
all O
the O
time O
I O
was O
with O
you O
. O

The O
Jews O
planned O
things O
against O
me O
, O
and O
this O
gave O
me O
much O
trouble O
. O

But O
you O
know O
that O
I O
always O
served O
the O
Lord O
, O
sometimes O
with O
tears O
. O

I O
never O
thought O
about O
myself O
first O
. O

I O
always O
did O
what O
was O
best O
for O
you O
. O

I O
told O
you O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
Jesus O
in O
public O
before O
the O
people O
and O
also O
taught O
in O
your O
homes O
. O

I O
told O
everyone O
-- O
Jewish O
and O
non-Jewish O
people O
-- O
to O
change O
and O
turn O
to O
God O
. O

I O
told O
them O
all O
to O
believe O
in O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O

`` O
But O
now O
I O
must O
obey O
the O
Spirit O
and O
go O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
will O
happen O
to O
me O
there O
. O

I O
know O
only O
that O
in O
every O
city O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
tells O
me O
that O
troubles O
and O
even O
jail O
wait O
for O
me O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
care O
about O
my O
own O
life O
. O

The O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
I O
finish O
my O
work O
. O

I O
want O
to O
finish O
the O
work O
that O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
gave O
me O
to O
do O
-- O
to O
tell O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
God O
's O
grace O
. O



`` O
And O
now O
listen O
to O
me O
. O

I O
know O
that O
none O
of O
you O
will O
ever O
see O
me O
again O
. O

All O
the O
time O
I O
was O
with O
you O
, O
I O
told O
you O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

So O
today O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
one O
thing O
that O
I O
am O
sure O
of O
: O
God O
will O
not O
blame O
me O
if O
some O
of O
you O
are O
not O
saved O
. O

I O
can O
say O
this O
because O
I O
know O
that O
I O
told O
you O
everything O
that O
God O
wants O
you O
to O
know O
. O

Be O
careful O
for O
yourselves O
and O
for O
all O
the O
people O
God O
has O
given O
you O
. O

The O
Holy O
Spirit O
gave O
you O
the O
work O
of O
caring O
for O
this O
flock O
. O

You O
must O
be O
like O
shepherds O
to O
the O
church O
of O
God O
. O

This O
is O
the O
church O
that O
God O
bought O
with O
his O
own O
blood O
. O

I O
know O
that O
after O
I O
leave O
, O
some O
men O
will O
come O
into O
your O
group O
. O

They O
will O
be O
like O
wild O
wolves O
and O
will O
try O
to O
destroy O
the O
flock O
. O

Also O
, O
men O
from O
your O
own O
group O
will O
begin O
to O
teach O
things O
that O
are O
wrong O
. O

They O
will O
lead O
some O
of O
the O
Lord O
's O
followers O
away O
from O
the O
truth O
to O
follow O
them O
. O

So O
be O
careful O
! O

And O
always O
remember O
what O
I O
did O
during O
the O
three O
years O
I O
was O
with O
you O
. O

I O
never O
stopped O
reminding O
each O
one O
of O
you O
how O
you O
should O
live O
, O
counseling O
you O
day O
and O
night O
and O
crying O
over O
you O
. O

`` O
Now O
I O
am O
putting O
you O
in O
God O
's O
care O
. O

I O
am O
depending O
on O
the O
message O
about O
his O
grace O
to O
make O
you O
strong O
. O

That O
message O
is O
able O
to O
give O
you O
the O
blessings O
that O
God O
gives O
to O
all O
his O
holy O
people O
. O

When O
I O
was O
with O
you O
, O
I O
never O
wanted O
anyone O
's O
money O
or O
fine O
clothes O
. O

You O
know O
that O
I O
always O
worked O
to O
take O
care O
of O
my O
own O
needs O
and O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
people O
who O
were O
with O
me O
. O

I O
always O
showed O
you O
that O
you O
should O
work O
just O
as O
I O
did O
and O
help O
people O
who O
are O
weak O
. O

I O
taught O
you O
to O
remember O
the O
words O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
: O
' O
You O
will O
have O
a O
greater O
blessing O
when O
you O
give O
than O
when O
you O
receive O
. O
' O
'' O

When O
Paul O
finished O
speaking O
, O
he O
knelt O
down O
, O
and O
they O
all O
prayed O
together O
. O

They O
cried O
and O
cried O
. O

They O
were O
especially O
sad O
because O
Paul O
had O
said O
they O
would O
never O
see O
him O
again O
. O

They O
hugged O
him O
and O
kissed O
him O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
with O
him O
to O
the O
ship O
to O
say O
goodbye O
. O




In O
the O
city O
of O
Caesarea O
there O
was O
a O
man O
named O
Cornelius O
, O
a O
Roman O
army O
officer O
in O
what O
was O
called O
the O
Italian O
Unit O
. O

He O
was O
a O
religious O
man O
. O

He O
and O
all O
the O
others O
who O
lived O
in O
his O
house O
were O
worshipers O
of O
the O
true O
God O
. O

He O
gave O
much O
of O
his O
money O
to O
help O
the O
poor O
people O
and O
always O
prayed O
to O
God O
. O

One O
afternoon O
about O
three O
o'clock O
, O
Cornelius O
had O
a O
vision O
. O

He O
clearly O
saw O
an O
angel O
from O
God O
coming O
to O
him O
and O
saying O
, O
`` O
Cornelius O
! O
'' O

Staring O
at O
the O
angel O
and O
feeling O
afraid O
, O
Cornelius O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
, O
sir O
? O
'' O

The O
angel O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
God O
has O
heard O
your O
prayers O
and O
has O
seen O
your O
gifts O
to O
the O
poor O
. O

He O
remembers O
you O
and O
all O
you O
have O
done O
. O

Send O
some O
men O
now O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Joppa O
to O
get O
a O
man O
named O
Simon O
, O
who O
is O
also O
called O
Peter O
. O

He O
is O
staying O
with O
someone O
also O
named O
Simon O
, O
a O
leatherworker O
who O
has O
a O
house O
beside O
the O
sea O
. O
'' O

The O
angel O
who O
spoke O
to O
Cornelius O
left O
. O

Then O
Cornelius O
called O
two O
of O
his O
servants O
and O
a O
soldier O
. O

The O
soldier O
was O
a O
religious O
man O
, O
one O
of O
his O
close O
helpers O
. O

Cornelius O
explained O
everything O
to O
these O
three O
men O
and O
sent O
them O
to O
Joppa O
. O

The O
next O
day O
they O
were O
coming O
near O
Joppa O
about O
noon O
, O
when O
Peter O
was O
going O
up O
to O
the O
roof O
to O
pray O
. O

He O
was O
hungry O
and O
wanted O
to O
eat O
. O

But O
while O
they O
were O
preparing O
the O
food O
for O
Peter O
to O
eat O
, O
he O
had O
a O
vision O
. O

He O
saw O
something O
coming O
down O
through O
the O
open O
sky O
. O

It O
looked O
like O
a O
big O
sheet O
being O
lowered O
to O
the O
ground O
by O
its O
four O
corners O
. O

In O
it O
were O
all O
kinds O
of O
animals O
, O
reptiles O
, O
and O
birds O
. O

Then O
a O
voice O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Get O
up O
, O
Peter O
; O
kill O
anything O
here O
and O
eat O
it O
. O
'' O

But O
Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
, O
Lord O
! O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
anything O
that O
is O
not O
pure O
or O
fit O
to O
be O
used O
for O
food O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
voice O
said O
to O
him O
again O
, O
`` O
God O
has O
made O
these O
things O
pure O
. O

Do O
n't O
say O
they O
are O
unfit O
to O
eat O
. O
'' O

This O
happened O
three O
times O
. O

Then O
the O
whole O
thing O
was O
taken O
back O
up O
into O
heaven O
. O

Peter O
wondered O
what O
this O
vision O
meant O
. O

The O
men O
Cornelius O
sent O
had O
found O
Simon O
's O
house O
. O

They O
were O
standing O
at O
the O
door O
. O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
Is O
Simon O
Peter O
staying O
here O
? O
'' O

While O
Peter O
was O
still O
thinking O
about O
the O
vision O
, O
the O
Spirit O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Listen O
, O
three O
men O
are O
looking O
for O
you O
. O

Get O
up O
and O
go O
downstairs O
. O

Go O
with O
these O
men O
without O
wondering O
if O
it O
's O
all O
right O
, O
because O
I O
sent O
them O
. O
'' O

So O
Peter O
went O
downstairs O
and O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
think O
I O
'm O
the O
man O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
. O

Why O
did O
you O
come O
here O
? O
'' O

The O
men O
said O
, O
`` O
A O
holy O
angel O
told O
Cornelius O
to O
invite O
you O
to O
his O
house O
. O

He O
is O
an O
army O
officer O
. O

He O
is O
a O
good O
man O
, O
one O
who O
worships O
God O
, O
and O
all O
the O
Jewish O
people O
respect O
him O
. O

The O
angel O
told O
him O
to O
invite O
you O
to O
his O
house O
so O
that O
he O
can O
listen O
to O
what O
you O
have O
to O
say O
. O
'' O

Peter O
asked O
the O
men O
to O
come O
in O
and O
stay O
for O
the O
night O
. O

The O
next O
day O
Peter O
got O
ready O
and O
went O
away O
with O
the O
three O
men O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
believers O
from O
Joppa O
went O
with O
him O
. O

The O
next O
day O
they O
came O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Caesarea O
. O

Cornelius O
was O
waiting O
for O
them O
and O
had O
already O
gathered O
his O
relatives O
and O
close O
friends O
at O
his O
house O
. O

When O
Peter O
entered O
the O
house O
, O
Cornelius O
met O
him O
. O

He O
fell O
down O
at O
Peter O
's O
feet O
and O
worshiped O
him O
. O

But O
Peter O
told O
him O
to O
get O
up O
. O

Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
Stand O
up O
! O

I O
am O
only O
a O
man O
like O
you O
. O
'' O

Peter O
continued O
talking O
with O
Cornelius O
. O

Then O
Peter O
went O
inside O
and O
saw O
a O
large O
group O
of O
people O
gathered O
there O
. O

Peter O
said O
to O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
You O
understand O
that O
it O
is O
against O
our O
law O
for O
a O
Jew O
to O
associate O
with O
or O
visit O
anyone O
who O
is O
not O
a O
Jew O
. O

But O
God O
has O
shown O
me O
that O
I O
should O
not O
consider O
anyone O
unfit O
or O
say O
they O
are O
not O
pure O
. O

That O
's O
why O
I O
did O
n't O
argue O
when O
your O
men O
asked O
me O
to O
come O
here O
. O

Now O
, O
please O
tell O
me O
why O
you O
sent O
for O
me O
. O
'' O



Cornelius O
said O
, O
`` O
Four O
days O
ago O
, O
I O
was O
praying O
in O
my O
house O
. O

It O
was O
at O
this O
same O
time O
-- O
three O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

Suddenly O
there O
was O
someone O
standing O
before O
me O
wearing O
bright O
, O
shiny O
clothes O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
Cornelius O
, O
God O
has O
heard O
your O
prayer O
and O
has O
seen O
your O
gifts O
to O
the O
poor O
. O

He O
remembers O
you O
and O
all O
you O
have O
done O
. O

So O
send O
some O
men O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Joppa O
and O
tell O
Simon O
Peter O
to O
come O
. O

He O
is O
staying O
with O
another O
man O
named O
Simon O
, O
a O
leatherworker O
who O
has O
a O
house O
beside O
the O
sea O
. O
' O

So O
I O
sent O
for O
you O
immediately O
. O

It O
was O
very O
good O
of O
you O
to O
come O
here O
. O

Now O
we O
are O
all O
here O
before O
God O
to O
hear O
everything O
the O
Lord O
has O
commanded O
you O
to O
tell O
us O
. O
'' O

Peter O
began O
to O
speak O
: O
`` O
I O
really O
understand O
now O
that O
God O
does O
not O
consider O
some O
people O
to O
be O
better O
than O
others O
. O

He O
accepts O
anyone O
who O
worships O
him O
and O
does O
what O
is O
right O
. O

It O
is O
not O
important O
what O
nation O
they O
come O
from O
. O

God O
has O
spoken O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
. O

He O
sent O
them O
the O
Good O
News O
that O
peace O
has O
come O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
the O
Lord O
of O
all O
people O
. O

`` O
You O
know O
what O
has O
happened O
all O
over O
Judea O
. O

It O
began O
in O
Galilee O
after O
John O
told O
the O
people O
they O
needed O
to O
be O
baptized O
. O

You O
know O
about O
Jesus O
from O
Nazareth O
. O

God O
made O
him O
the O
Christ O
by O
giving O
him O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
and O
power O
. O

Jesus O
went O
everywhere O
doing O
good O
for O
people O
. O

He O
healed O
those O
who O
were O
ruled O
by O
the O
devil O
, O
showing O
that O
God O
was O
with O
him O
. O

`` O
We O
saw O
all O
that O
Jesus O
did O
in O
Judea O
and O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

But O
he O
was O
killed O
. O

They O
put O
him O
on O
a O
cross O
made O
of O
wood O
. O

But O
on O
the O
third O
day O
after O
his O
death O
, O
God O
raised O
him O
to O
life O
and O
let O
him O
be O
seen O
openly O
. O

He O
was O
not O
seen O
by O
everyone O
, O
but O
only O
by O
us O
, O
the O
ones O
God O
had O
already O
chosen O
to O
be O
witnesses O
. O

We O
ate O
and O
drank O
with O
him O
after O
he O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

`` O
Jesus O
told O
us O
to O
go O
and O
speak O
to O
the O
people O

He O
told O
us O
to O
tell O
them O
that O
he O
is O
the O
one O
God O
chose O
to O
be O
the O
Judge O
of O
all O
who O
are O
living O
and O
all O
who O
have O
died O
. O

Everyone O
who O
believes O
in O
Jesus O
will O
have O
their O
sins O
forgiven O
through O
his O
name O
. O

All O
the O
prophets O
agree O
that O
this O
is O
true O
. O
'' O

While O
Peter O
was O
still O
speaking O
these O
words O
, O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
came O
down O
on O
all O
those O
who O
were O
listening O
to O
his O
speech O
. O

The O
Jewish O
believers O
who O
came O
with O
Peter O
were O
amazed O
that O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
had O
been O
poured O
out O
as O
a O
gift O
also O
to O
people O
who O
were O
not O
Jews O
. O

They O
heard O
them O
speaking O
different O
languages O
and O
praising O
God O
. O

Then O
Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
How O
can O
anyone O
object O
to O
these O
people O
being O
baptized O
in O
water O
? O

They O
have O
received O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
the O
same O
as O
we O
did O
! O

So O
Peter O
told O
them O
to O
baptize O
Cornelius O
and O
his O
relatives O
and O
friends O
in O
the O
name O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Then O
they O
asked O
Peter O
to O
stay O
with O
them O
for O
a O
few O
days O

Sunday O
morning O
, O
while O
it O
was O
still O
dark O
, O
Mary O
Magdalene O
went O
to O
the O
tomb O
. O

She O
saw O
that O
the O
large O
stone O
was O
moved O
away O
from O
the O
entrance O
. O

So O
she O
ran O
to O
Simon O
Peter O
and O
the O
other O
follower O
-LRB- O
the O
one O
Jesus O
loved O
very O
much O
-RRB- O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
They O
have O
taken O
the O
Lord O
out O
of O
the O
tomb O
, O
and O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
they O
put O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
Peter O
and O
the O
other O
follower O
started O
going O
to O
the O
tomb O
. O

They O
were O
both O
running O
, O
but O
the O
other O
follower O
ran O
faster O
than O
Peter O
and O
reached O
the O
tomb O
first O
. O

He O
bent O
down O
and O
looked O
in O
. O

He O
saw O
the O
pieces O
of O
linen O
cloth O
lying O
there O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
go O
in O
. O

Then O
Simon O
Peter O
finally O
reached O
the O
tomb O
and O
went O
in O
. O

He O
saw O
the O
pieces O
of O
linen O
lying O
there O
. O

He O
also O
saw O
the O
cloth O
that O
had O
been O
around O
Jesus O
' O
head O
. O

It O
was O
folded O
up O
and O
laid O
in O
a O
different O
place O
from O
the O
pieces O
of O
linen O
. O

Then O
the O
other O
follower O
went O
in O
-- O
the O
one O
who O
had O
reached O
the O
tomb O
first O
. O

He O
saw O
what O
had O
happened O
and O
believed O
. O

-LRB- O
These O
followers O
did O
not O
yet O
understand O
from O
the O
Scriptures O
that O
Jesus O
must O
rise O
from O
death O
. O
-RRB- O

Then O
the O
followers O
went O
back O
home O
. O

But O
Mary O
stood O
outside O
the O
tomb O
, O
crying O
. O

While O
she O
was O
crying O
, O
she O
bent O
down O
and O
looked O
inside O
the O
tomb O
. O

She O
saw O
two O
angels O
dressed O
in O
white O
sitting O
where O
Jesus O
' O
body O
had O
been O
. O

One O
was O
sitting O
where O
the O
head O
had O
been O
; O
the O
other O
was O
sitting O
where O
the O
feet O
had O
been O
. O

The O
angels O
asked O
Mary O
, O
`` O
Woman O
, O
why O
are O
you O
crying O
? O
'' O

Mary O
answered O
, O
`` O
They O
took O
away O
the O
body O
of O
my O
Lord O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
they O
put O
him O
. O
'' O

When O
Mary O
said O
this O
, O
she O
turned O
around O
and O
saw O
Jesus O
standing O
there O
. O

But O
she O
did O
not O
know O
that O
it O
was O
Jesus O
. O

He O
asked O
her O
, O
`` O
Woman O
, O
why O
are O
you O
crying O
? O

Who O
are O
you O
looking O
for O
? O
'' O

She O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
the O
man O
who O
takes O
care O
of O
the O
garden O
. O

So O
she O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Did O
you O
take O
him O
away O
, O
sir O
? O

Tell O
me O
where O
you O
put O
him O
. O

I O
will O
go O
and O
get O
him O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Mary O
. O
'' O

She O
turned O
toward O
him O
and O
said O
in O
Aramaic O
, O
`` O
Rabboni O
, O
'' O
which O
means O
`` O
Teacher O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
You O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
me O
! O

I O
have O
not O
yet O
gone O
back O
up O
to O
the O
Father O
. O

But O
go O
to O
my O
followers O
and O
tell O
them O
this O
: O
' O
I O
am O
going O
back O
to O
my O
Father O
and O
your O
Father O
. O

I O
am O
going O
back O
to O
my O
God O
and O
your O
God O
. O
' O
'' O

Mary O
Magdalene O
went O
to O
the O
followers O
and O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
saw O
the O
Lord O
! O
'' O

And O
she O
told O
them O
what O
he O
had O
said O
to O
her O
. O

The O
day O
was O
Sunday O
, O
and O
that O
same O
evening O
the O
followers O
were O
together O
. O

They O
had O
the O
doors O
locked O
because O
they O
were O
afraid O
of O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
Jesus O
was O
standing O
there O
among O
them O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Peace O
be O
with O
you O
! O
'' O

As O
soon O
as O
he O
said O
this O
, O
he O
showed O
them O
his O
hands O
and O
his O
side O
. O

When O
the O
followers O
saw O
the O
Lord O
, O
they O
were O
very O
happy O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
again O
, O
`` O
Peace O
be O
with O
you O
. O

It O
was O
the O
Father O
who O
sent O
me O
, O
and O
I O
am O
now O
sending O
you O
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
breathed O
on O
them O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Receive O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

If O
you O
forgive O
the O
sins O
of O
anyone O
, O
their O
sins O
are O
forgiven O
. O

If O
there O
is O
anyone O
whose O
sins O
you O
do O
n't O
forgive O
, O
their O
sins O
are O
not O
forgiven O
. O
'' O

Thomas O
-LRB- O
called O
Didymus O
-RRB- O
was O
one O
of O
the O
twelve O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
with O
the O
other O
followers O
when O
Jesus O
came O
. O

They O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
We O
saw O
the O
Lord O
. O
'' O

Thomas O
said O
, O
`` O
That O
's O
hard O
to O
believe O
. O

I O
will O
have O
to O
see O
the O
nail O
holes O
in O
his O
hands O
, O
put O
my O
finger O
where O
the O
nails O
were O
, O
and O
put O
my O
hand O
into O
his O
side O
. O

Only O
then O
will O
I O
believe O
it O
. O
'' O

A O
week O
later O
the O
followers O
were O
in O
the O
house O
again O
, O
and O
Thomas O
was O
with O
them O
. O

The O
doors O
were O
locked O
, O
but O
Jesus O
came O
and O
stood O
among O
them O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Peace O
be O
with O
you O
! O
'' O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
Thomas O
, O
`` O
Put O
your O
finger O
here O
. O

Look O
at O
my O
hands O
. O

Put O
your O
hand O
here O
in O
my O
side O
. O

Stop O
doubting O
and O
believe O

'' O

Thomas O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
My O
Lord O
and O
my O
God O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
believe O
because O
you O
see O
me O
. O

Great O
blessings O
belong O
to O
the O
people O
who O
believe O
without O
seeing O
me O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
did O
many O
other O
miraculous O
signs O
that O
his O
followers O
saw O
, O
which O
are O
not O
written O
in O
this O
book O
. O

But O
these O
are O
written O
so O
that O
you O
can O
believe O
that O
Jesus O
is O
the O
Christ O
, O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O

Then O
, O
by O
believing O
, O
you O
can O
have O
life O
through O
his O
name O
. O




Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
certainly O
true O
that O
when O
a O
man O
enters O
the O
sheep O
pen O
, O
he O
should O
use O
the O
gate O
. O

If O
he O
climbs O
in O
some O
other O
way O
, O
he O
is O
a O
robber O
. O

He O
is O
trying O
to O
steal O
the O
sheep O
. O

But O
the O
man O
who O
takes O
care O
of O
the O
sheep O
enters O
through O
the O
gate O
. O

He O
is O
the O
shepherd O
. O

The O
man O
who O
guards O
the O
gate O
opens O
the O
gate O
for O
the O
shepherd O
. O

And O
the O
sheep O
listen O
to O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
shepherd O
. O

He O
calls O
his O
own O
sheep O
, O
using O
their O
names O
, O
and O
he O
leads O
them O
out O
. O

He O
brings O
all O
of O
his O
sheep O
out O
. O

Then O
he O
goes O
ahead O
of O
them O
and O
leads O
them O
. O

The O
sheep O
follow O
him O
, O
because O
they O
know O
his O
voice O
. O

But O
sheep O
will O
never O
follow O
someone O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

They O
will O
run O
away O
from O
him O
, O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
his O
voice O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
told O
the O
people O
this O
story O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
understand O
what O
it O
meant O
. O

So O
Jesus O
said O
again O
, O
`` O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
I O
am O
the O
gate O
for O
the O
sheep O
. O

All O
those O
who O
came O
before O
me O
were O
thieves O
and O
robbers O
. O

The O
sheep O
did O
not O
listen O
to O
them O
. O

I O
am O
the O
gate O
. O

Whoever O
enters O
through O
me O
will O
be O
saved O
. O

They O
will O
be O
able O
to O
come O
in O
and O
go O
out O
. O

They O
will O
find O
everything O
they O
need O
. O

A O
thief O
comes O
to O
steal O
, O
kill O
, O
and O
destroy O
. O

But O
I O
came O
to O
give O
life O
-- O
life O
that O
is O
full O
and O
good O
. O

`` O
I O
am O
the O
good O
shepherd O
, O
and O
the O
good O
shepherd O
gives O
his O
life O
for O
the O
sheep O
. O

The O
worker O
who O
is O
paid O
to O
keep O
the O
sheep O
is O
different O
from O
the O
shepherd O
. O

The O
paid O
worker O
does O
not O
own O
the O
sheep O
. O

So O
when O
he O
sees O
a O
wolf O
coming O
, O
he O
runs O
away O
and O
leaves O
the O
sheep O
alone O
. O

Then O
the O
wolf O
attacks O
the O
sheep O
and O
scatters O
them O
. O

The O
man O
runs O
away O
because O
he O
is O
only O
a O
paid O
worker O
. O

He O
does O
not O
really O
care O
for O
the O
sheep O
. O

`` O
I O
am O
the O
shepherd O
who O
cares O
for O
the O
sheep O
. O

I O
know O
my O
sheep O
just O
as O
the O
Father O

me O

And O
my O
sheep O
know O
me O
just O
as O
I O
know O
the O
Father O

I O
give O
my O
life O
for O
these O
sheep O

I O
have O
other O
sheep O
too O
. O

They O
are O
not O
in O
this O
flock O
here O
. O

I O
must O
lead O
them O
also O
. O

They O
will O
listen O
to O
my O
voice O

In O
the O
future O
there O
will O
be O
one O
flock O
and O
one O
shepherd O
. O

The O
Father O
loves O
me O
because O
I O
give O
my O
life O
. O

I O
give O
my O
life O
so O
that O
I O
can O
get O
it O
back O
again O
. O

No O
one O
takes O
my O
life O
away O
from O
me O

give O
my O
own O
life O
freely O

I O
have O
the O
right O
to O
give O
my O
life O

and O
I O
have O
the O
right O
to O
get O
it O
back O
again O

This O
is O
what O
the O
Father O
told O
me O

'' O

Again O
the O
Jews O
were O
divided O
over O
what O
Jesus O
was O
saying O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
said O
, O
`` O
A O
demon O
has O
come O
into O
him O
and O
made O
him O
crazy O

Why O
listen O
to O
him O
? O
'' O

But O
others O
said O
, O
`` O
These O
are O

the O
words O
of O
someone O
controlled O
by O
a O
demon O

It O
was O
winter O

and O
the O
time O
came O
for O
the O
Festival O
of O
Dedication O
at O
Jerusalem O
. O

Jesus O
was O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
at O
Solomon O
's O
Porch O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
gathered O
around O
him O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
How O
long O
will O
you O
make O
us O
wonder O
about O
you O
? O

If O
you O
are O
the O
Christ O

then O
tell O
us O
clearly O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
told O
you O
already O
, O
but O
you O
did O
not O
believe O

I O
do O
miracles O
in O
my O
Father O

name O

These O
miracles O
show O
who O
I O
am O

But O
you O
do O
not O
believe O

because O
you O
are O

Again O
the O
Jews O
there O
picked O
up O
stones O
to O
kill O
Jesus O

But O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
The O
many O
wonderful O
things O

Which O
of O
these O
good O
things O
are O
you O
killing O
me O
for O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
are O
not O
killing O
you O
for O
any O
good O
thing O

did O

But O
you O

things O

you O
say O
you O

That O
is O
why O
we O
are O
trying O
to O
kill O
you O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
written O
in O
your O
law O
that O
God O
said O
, O
' O
I O
said O

This O
Scripture O
called O
those O

gods O

the O
people O
who O
received O
God O

message O

And O
Scripture O
is O
always O
true O

So O
why O
do O
you O
accuse O
me O
of O
insulting O
God O
for O
saying O
, O
' O
I O
am O
God O
's O

I O

If O
I O
do O

do O
what O
my O

do O

believe O
what O
I O

But O
if O
I O
do O

you O

you O

They O
tried O

They O
all O
ate O
the O
same O
spiritual O
food O
, O
and O
they O
all O
drank O
the O
same O
spiritual O
drink O
. O

They O
drank O
from O
that O
spiritual O
rock O
that O
was O
with O
them O
, O
and O
that O
rock O
was O
Christ O
. O

But O
God O
was O
not O
pleased O
with O
most O
of O
those O
people O
, O
so O
they O
were O
killed O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

And O
these O
things O
that O
happened O
are O
examples O
for O
us O
. O

These O
examples O
should O
stop O
us O
from O
wanting O
evil O
things O
like O
those O
people O
did O
. O

Do O
n't O
worship O
idols O
as O
some O
of O
them O
did O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
people O
sat O
down O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
and O
then O
got O
up O
to O
have O
a O
wild O
party O
. O
'' O

We O
should O
not O
commit O
sexual O
sins O
as O
some O
of O
them O
did O
. O

In O
one O
day O
23 O
, O
000 O
of O
them O
died O
because O
of O
their O
sin O
. O

We O
should O
not O
test O
Christ O
as O
some O
of O
them O
did O
. O

Because O
of O
that O
, O
they O
were O
killed O
by O
snakes O
. O

And O
do O
n't O
complain O
as O
some O
of O
them O
did O
. O

Because O
they O
complained O
, O
they O
were O
killed O
by O
the O
angel O
that O
destroys O
. O

The O
things O
that O
happened O
to O
those O
people O
are O
examples O
. O

They O
were O
written O
to O
be O
warnings O
for O
us O
. O

We O
live O
in O
the O
time O
that O
all O
those O
past O
histories O
were O
pointing O
to O
. O

So O
anyone O
who O
thinks O
they O
are O
standing O
strong O
should O
be O
careful O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
fall O
. O

The O
only O
temptations O
that O
you O
have O
are O
the O
same O
temptations O
that O
all O
people O
have O
. O

But O
you O
can O
trust O
God O
. O

He O
will O
not O
let O
you O
be O
tempted O
more O
than O
you O
can O
bear O
. O

But O
when O
you O
are O
tempted O
, O
God O
will O
also O
give O
you O
a O
way O
to O
escape O
that O
temptation O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
endure O
it O
. O

So O
, O
my O
dear O
friends O
, O
stay O
away O
from O
worshiping O
idols O
. O

You O
are O
intelligent O
people O
. O

Judge O
for O
yourselves O
the O
truth O
of O
what O
I O
say O
now O
. O



The O
cup O
of O
blessing O
that O
we O
give O
thanks O
for O
is O
a O
sharing O
in O
the O
blood O
sacrifice O
of O
Christ O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
? O

And O
the O
bread O
that O
we O
break O
is O
a O
sharing O
in O
the O
body O
of O
Christ O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
? O

There O
is O
one O
loaf O
of O
bread O
, O
so O
we O
who O
are O
many O
are O
one O
body O
, O
because O
we O
all O
share O
in O
that O
one O
loaf O
. O

And O
think O
about O
what O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
do O
. O

When O
they O
eat O
the O
sacrifices O
, O
they O
are O
united O
by O
sharing O
what O
was O
offered O
on O
the O
altar O
. O

So O
, O
am O
I O
saying O
that O
sacrifices O
to O
idols O
are O
the O
same O
as O
those O
Jewish O
sacrifices O
? O

No O
, O
because O
an O
idol O
is O
nothing O
, O
and O
the O
things O
offered O
to O
idols O
are O
worth O
nothing O
. O

But O
I O
am O
saying O
that O
when O
food O
is O
sacrificed O
to O
idols O
, O
it O
is O
an O
offering O
to O
demons O
, O
not O
to O
God O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
share O
anything O
with O
demons O
. O

You O
can O
not O
drink O
the O
cup O
of O
the O
Lord O
and O
then O
go O
drink O
a O
cup O
that O
honors O
demons O
. O

You O
can O
not O
share O
a O
meal O
at O
the O
Lord O
's O
table O
and O
then O
go O
share O
a O
meal O
that O
honors O
demons O
. O

Doing O
that O
would O
make O
the O
Lord O
jealous O
. O

Do O
you O
really O
want O
to O
do O
that O
? O

Do O
you O
think O
we O
are O
stronger O
than O
he O
is O
? O

`` O
All O
things O
are O
allowed O
, O
'' O
you O
say O
. O

But O
not O
all O
things O
are O
good O
. O

`` O
All O
things O
are O
allowed O
. O
'' O

But O
some O
things O
do O
n't O
help O
anyone O
. O

Try O
to O
do O
what O
is O
good O
for O
others O
, O
not O
just O
what O
is O
good O
for O
yourselves O
. O

Eat O
any O
meat O
that O
is O
sold O
in O
the O
meat O
market O
. O

Do O
n't O
ask O
questions O
about O
it O
to O
see O
if O
it O
is O
something O
you O
think O
is O
wrong O
to O
eat O
. O

You O
can O
eat O
it O
, O
`` O
because O
the O
earth O
and O
everything O
in O
it O
belong O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O
'' O

Someone O
who O
is O
not O
a O
believer O
might O
invite O
you O
to O
eat O
with O
them O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
go O
, O
then O
eat O
anything O
that O
is O
put O
before O
you O
. O

Do O
n't O
ask O
questions O
to O
see O
if O
it O
is O
something O
you O
think O
is O
wrong O
to O
eat O
. O

But O
if O
someone O
tells O
you O
, O
`` O
That O
food O
was O
offered O
to O
idols O
, O
'' O
then O
do O
n't O
eat O
it O
. O

That O
's O
because O
some O
people O
think O
it O
is O
wrong O
, O
and O
it O
might O
cause O
a O
problem O
for O
the O
person O
who O
told O
you O
that O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
mean O
that O
you O
think O
it O
is O
wrong O
. O

But O
the O
other O
person O
might O
think O
it O
is O
wrong O
. O

That O
's O
the O
only O
reason O
not O
to O
eat O
it O
. O

My O
own O
freedom O
should O
not O
be O
judged O
by O
what O
another O
person O
thinks O
. O

I O
eat O
the O
meal O
with O
thankfulness O
. O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
criticized O
because O
of O
something O
I O
thank O
God O
for O
. O

So O
if O
you O
eat O
, O
or O
if O
you O
drink O
, O
or O
if O
you O
do O
anything O
, O
do O
it O
for O
the O
glory O
of O
God O
. O

Never O
do O
anything O
that O
might O
make O
other O
people O
do O
wrong O
-- O
Jews O
, O
non-Jews O
, O
or O
anyone O
in O
God O
's O
church O
. O

I O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

I O
try O
to O
please O
everyone O
in O
every O
way O
. O

I O
am O
not O
trying O
to O
do O
what O
is O
good O
for O
me O
. O

I O
am O
trying O
to O
do O
what O
is O
good O
for O
the O
most O
people O
so O
that O
they O
can O
be O
saved O
. O




Then O
Jesus O
left O
there O
and O
went O
into O
the O
area O
of O
Judea O
and O
across O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

Again O
, O
many O
people O
came O
to O
him O
, O
and O
Jesus O
taught O
them O
as O
he O
always O
did O
. O

Some O
Pharisees O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
tried O
to O
make O
him O
say O
something O
wrong O
. O

They O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Is O
it O
right O
for O
a O
man O
to O
divorce O
his O
wife O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
What O
did O
Moses O
command O
you O
to O
do O
? O
'' O

The O
Pharisees O
said O
, O
`` O
Moses O
allowed O
a O
man O
to O
divorce O
his O
wife O
by O
writing O
a O
certificate O
of O
divorce O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Moses O
wrote O
that O
command O
for O
you O
because O
you O
refused O
to O
accept O
God O
's O
teaching O
. O

But O
when O
God O
made O
the O
world O
, O
' O
he O
made O
people O
male O
and O
female O
. O
' O

' O
That O
is O
why O
a O
man O
will O
leave O
his O
father O
and O
mother O
and O
be O
joined O
to O
his O
wife O
. O

And O
the O
two O
people O
will O
become O
one O
. O
' O

So O
they O
are O
no O
longer O
two O
, O
but O
one O
. O

God O
has O
joined O
them O
together O
, O
so O
no O
one O
should O
separate O
them O
. O
'' O

Later O
, O
when O
the O
followers O
and O
Jesus O
were O
in O
the O
house O
, O
they O
asked O
him O
again O
about O
the O
question O
of O
divorce O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Whoever O
divorces O
his O
wife O
and O
marries O
another O
woman O
has O
sinned O
against O
his O
wife O
. O

He O
is O
guilty O
of O
adultery O
. O

And O
the O
woman O
who O
divorces O
her O
husband O
and O
marries O
another O
man O
is O
also O
guilty O
of O
adultery O
. O
'' O

People O
brought O
their O
small O
children O
to O
Jesus O
, O
so O
that O
he O
could O
lay O
his O
hands O
on O
them O
to O
bless O
them O
. O

But O
the O
followers O
told O
the O
people O
to O
stop O
bringing O
their O
children O
to O
him O
. O

Jesus O
saw O
what O
happened O
. O

He O
did O
not O
like O
his O
followers O
telling O
the O
children O
not O
to O
come O
. O

So O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Let O
the O
little O
children O
come O
to O
me O
. O

Do O
n't O
stop O
them O
, O
because O
God O
's O
kingdom O
belongs O
to O
people O
who O
are O
like O
these O
little O
children O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
you O
must O
accept O
God O
's O
kingdom O
like O
a O
little O
child O
accepts O
things O
, O
or O
you O
will O
never O
enter O
it O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
held O
the O
children O
in O
his O
arms O
. O

He O
laid O
his O
hands O
on O
them O
and O
blessed O
them O
. O

Jesus O
started O
to O
leave O
, O
but O
a O
man O
ran O
to O
him O
and O
bowed O
down O
on O
his O
knees O
before O
him O
. O

The O
man O
asked O
, O
`` O
Good O
Teacher O
, O
what O
must O
I O
do O
to O
get O
the O
life O
that O
never O
ends O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
call O
me O
good O
? O

Only O
God O
is O
good O
. O

And O
you O
know O
his O
commands O
: O
' O
You O
must O
not O
murder O
anyone O
, O
you O
must O
not O
commit O
adultery O
, O
you O
must O
not O
steal O
, O
you O
must O
not O
lie O
, O
you O
must O
not O
cheat O
, O
you O
must O
respect O
your O
father O
and O
mother O
. O
. O
. O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
man O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
I O
have O
obeyed O
all O
these O
commands O
since O
I O
was O
a O
boy O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
looked O
at O
the O
man O
in O
a O
way O
that O
showed O
how O
much O
he O
cared O
for O
him O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
There O
is O
still O
one O
thing O
you O
need O
to O
do O
. O

Go O
and O
sell O
everything O
you O
have O
. O

Give O
the O
money O
to O
those O
who O
are O
poor O
, O
and O
you O
will O
have O
riches O
in O
heaven O
. O

Then O
come O
and O
follow O
me O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
was O
upset O
when O
Jesus O
told O
him O
to O
give O
away O
his O
money O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
this O
, O
because O
he O
was O
very O
rich O
. O

So O
he O
went O
away O
sad O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
looked O
at O
his O
followers O
and O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
It O
will O
be O
very O
hard O
for O
a O
rich O
person O
to O
enter O
God O
's O
kingdom O
! O
'' O

The O
followers O
were O
amazed O
at O
what O
Jesus O
said O
. O

But O
he O
said O
again O
, O
`` O
My O
children O
, O
it O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
enter O
God O
's O
kingdom O
! O



It O
is O
easier O
for O
a O
camel O
to O
go O
through O
the O
eye O
of O
a O
needle O
than O
for O
a O
rich O
person O
to O
enter O
God O
's O
kingdom O
! O
'' O

The O
followers O
were O
even O
more O
amazed O
and O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
Then O
who O
can O
be O
saved O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
looked O
at O
them O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
That O
is O
something O
people O
can O
not O
do O
, O
but O
God O
can O

He O
can O
do O
anything O
. O
'' O

Peter O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
We O
left O
everything O
to O
follow O
you O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
can O
promise O
that O
everyone O
who O
has O
left O
their O

for O

get O
a O
hundred O
times O
more O
than O

more O
homes O

with O
these O

persecutions O

in O
the O
world O
that O
is O
coming O
they O
will O
also O
get O
the O
reward O

eternal O
life O

Many O

the O

the O
highest O

'' O

Jesus O
and O
those O
with O
him O
were O
on O
their O
way O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
was O
at O
the O
front O
of O
the O
group O
. O

His O
followers O
were O
wondering O
what O
was O
happening O
, O
and O
the O
people O
who O
followed O
behind O
them O
were O
feeling O
afraid O
. O

Jesus O
gathered O
the O
twelve O
apostles O
again O
and O
talked O
with O
them O
alone O
. O

He O
told O
them O
what O
would O
happen O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
are O
going O
to O
Jerusalem O

The O
Son O

Man O
will O
be O
handed O
over O

the O
leading O
priests O

teachers O

the O
law O

They O
will O
say O
that O

will O

him O
over O
to O
the O
foreigners O

who O
will O
laugh O
at O
him O

spit O
on O
him O

They O
will O
beat O
him O
with O
whips O

kill O
him O

But O
on O
the O
third O
day O
after O
his O
death O

he O

rise O

Then O
James O
and O
John O
, O
sons O
of O
Zebedee O
, O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O

`` O

The O
sons O

sons O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
we O
can O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
sons O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
true O
that O
you O
will O
drink O
from O
the O
cup O
that O
I O
drink O
from O
. O

And O
you O
will O
be O
baptized O
with O
the O
same O
baptism O
that O
I O
must O
go O
through O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
for O
me O
to O
say O
who O
will O
sit O
at O
my O
right O
or O
my O
left O
. O

God O
has O
prepared O
those O
places O
for O
the O
ones O
he O
chooses O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
other O
ten O
followers O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
were O
angry O
with O
James O
and O
John O
. O



Jesus O
called O
all O
the O
followers O
together O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
non-Jewish O
people O
have O
men O
they O
call O
rulers O
. O

You O
know O
that O
those O
rulers O
love O
to O
show O
their O
power O
over O
the O
people O
. O

And O
their O
important O
leaders O
love O
to O
use O
all O
their O
authority O
over O
the O
people O
. O

But O
it O
should O
not O
be O
that O
way O
with O
you O
. O

Whoever O
wants O
to O
be O
your O
leader O
must O
be O
your O
servant O
. O

Whoever O
wants O
to O
be O
first O
must O
serve O
the O
rest O
of O
you O
like O
a O
slave O
. O

Follow O
my O
example O
: O
Even O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
did O
not O
come O
for O
people O
to O
serve O
him O
. O

He O
came O
to O
serve O
others O
and O
to O
give O
his O
life O
to O
save O
many O
people O
. O
'' O

Then O
they O
came O
to O
the O
town O
of O
Jericho O
. O

When O
Jesus O
left O
there O
with O
his O
followers O
, O
a O
large O
crowd O
was O
with O
them O
. O

A O
blind O
man O
named O
Bartimaeus O
-LRB- O
meaning O
`` O
son O
of O
Timaeus O
'' O
-RRB- O

was O
sitting O
by O
the O
road O
. O

He O
was O
always O
begging O
for O
money O
. O

He O
heard O
that O
Jesus O
from O
Nazareth O
was O
walking O
by O
. O

So O
he O
began O
shouting O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
, O
Son O
of O
David O
, O
please O
help O
me O
! O
'' O

Many O
people O
criticized O
the O
blind O
man O
and O
told O
him O
to O
be O
quiet O
. O

But O
he O
shouted O
more O
and O
more O
, O
`` O
Son O
of O
David O
, O
please O
help O
me O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
stopped O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Tell O
him O
to O
come O
here O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
called O
the O
blind O
man O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
can O
be O
happy O
now O
. O

Stand O
up O
! O

Jesus O
is O
calling O
you O
. O
'' O

The O
blind O
man O
stood O
up O
quickly O
. O

He O
left O
his O
coat O
there O
and O
went O
to O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
asked O
the O
man O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
do O
for O
you O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
I O
want O
to O
see O
again O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
. O

You O
are O
healed O
because O
you O
believed O
. O
'' O

Immediately O
the O
man O
was O
able O
to O
see O
again O
. O

He O
followed O
Jesus O
down O
the O
road O
. O




Jesus O
called O
his O
twelve O
followers O
together O
. O

He O
gave O
them O
power O
over O
evil O
spirits O
and O
power O
to O
heal O
every O
kind O
of O
disease O
and O
sickness O

These O
are O

Iscariot O
-LRB- O
the O
one O
who O
handed O
Jesus O
over O
to O
his O
enemies O
-RRB- O

Jesus O
sent O
the O
twelve O
men O
out O
with O
these O
instructions O
: O
`` O

take O

I O

Jesus O
was O
going O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

His O
twelve O
followers O
were O
with O
him O
. O

While O
they O
were O
walking O
, O
he O
gathered O
the O
followers O
together O
and O
spoke O
to O
them O
privately O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
We O
are O
going O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

The O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
, O
and O
they O
will O
say O
he O
must O
die O
. O

They O
will O
hand O
him O
over O
to O
the O
foreigners O
, O
who O
will O
laugh O
at O
him O
and O
beat O
him O
with O
whips O
, O
and O
then O
they O
will O
kill O
him O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

But O
on O
the O
third O
day O
after O
his O
death O
, O
he O
will O
be O
raised O
to O
life O
again O
. O
'' O

Then O
Zebedee O
's O
wife O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
brought O
her O
sons O
. O

She O
bowed O
before O
Jesus O
and O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
something O
for O
her O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
? O
'' O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
Promise O
that O
one O
of O
my O
sons O
will O
sit O
at O
your O
right O
side O
in O
your O
kingdom O
and O
the O
other O
at O
your O
left O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
sons O
, O
`` O
You O
do O
n't O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
asking O
. O

Can O
you O
drink O
from O
the O
cup O
that O
I O
must O
drink O
from O
? O
'' O

The O
sons O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
we O
can O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
true O
that O
you O
will O
drink O
from O
the O
cup O
that O
I O
drink O
from O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
for O
me O
to O
say O
who O
will O
sit O
at O
my O
right O
or O
my O
left O
. O

My O
Father O
has O
decided O
who O
will O
do O
that O
. O

He O
has O
prepared O
those O
places O
for O
them O
. O
'' O

The O
other O
ten O
followers O
heard O
this O
and O
were O
angry O
with O
the O
two O
brothers O
. O

So O
Jesus O
called O
the O
followers O
together O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
know O
that O
the O
rulers O
of O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
love O
to O
show O
their O
power O
over O
the O
people O
. O

And O
their O
important O
leaders O
love O
to O
use O
all O
their O
authority O
over O
the O
people O
. O

But O
it O
should O
not O
be O
that O
way O
with O
you O
. O

Whoever O
wants O
to O
be O
your O
leader O
must O
be O
your O
servant O
. O

Whoever O
wants O
to O
be O
first O
must O
serve O
the O
rest O
of O
you O
like O
a O
slave O
. O

Do O
as O
I O
did O
: O
The O
Son O
of O
Man O
did O
not O
come O
for O
people O
to O
serve O
him O
. O

He O
came O
to O
serve O
others O
and O
to O
give O
his O
life O
to O
save O
many O
people O
. O
'' O

When O
Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
were O
leaving O
Jericho O
, O
a O
large O
crowd O
followed O
him O
. O

There O
were O
two O
blind O
men O
sitting O
by O
the O
road O
. O

They O
heard O
that O
Jesus O
was O
coming O
by O
. O

So O
they O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
Son O
of O
David O
, O
please O
help O
us O
! O
'' O

The O
people O
there O
criticized O
the O
blind O
men O
and O
told O
them O
to O
be O
quiet O
. O

But O
they O
shouted O
more O
and O
more O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
Son O
of O
David O
, O
please O
help O
us O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
stopped O
and O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
do O
for O
you O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
we O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
see O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
felt O
sorry O
for O
the O
blind O
men O
. O

He O
touched O
their O
eyes O
, O
and O
immediately O
they O
were O
able O
to O
see O
. O

Then O
they O
became O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
. O




I O
, O
Paul O
, O
am O
begging O
you O
with O
the O
gentleness O
and O
the O
kindness O
of O
Christ O
. O

Some O
say O
that O
I O
am O
bold O
when O
I O
am O
writing O
you O
from O
a O
distance O
, O
but O
not O
when O
I O
am O
there O
with O
you O
. O

They O
think O
our O
motives O
for O
what O
we O
do O
are O
like O
those O
of O
the O
world O
. O

I O
plan O
to O
be O
very O
bold O
against O
those O
people O
when O
I O
come O
. O

I O
hope O
I O
will O
not O
need O
to O
use O
that O
same O
boldness O
with O
you O
. O

We O
live O
in O
this O
world O
, O
but O
we O
do O
n't O
fight O
our O
battles O
in O
the O
same O
way O
the O
world O
does O
. O

The O
weapons O
we O
use O
are O
not O
human O
ones O
. O

Our O
weapons O
have O
power O
from O
God O
and O
can O
destroy O
the O
enemy O
's O
strong O
places O
. O

We O
destroy O
people O
's O
arguments O
, O
and O
we O
tear O
down O
every O
proud O
idea O
that O
raises O
itself O
against O
the O
knowledge O
of O
God O
. O

We O
also O
capture O
every O
thought O
and O
make O
it O
give O
up O
and O
obey O
Christ O
. O

We O
are O
ready O
to O
punish O
anyone O
there O
who O
does O
not O
obey O
, O
but O
first O
we O
want O
you O
to O
be O
fully O
obedient O
. O

You O
must O
look O
at O
the O
facts O
before O
you O
. O

If O
you O
feel O
sure O
you O
belong O
to O
Christ O
, O
you O
must O
remember O
that O
we O
belong O
to O
Christ O
the O
same O
as O
you O
do O
. O

It O
may O
seem O
as O
though O
we O
boast O
too O
much O
about O
the O
authority O
the O
Lord O
gave O
us O
. O

But O
he O
gave O
us O
this O
authority O
to O
strengthen O
you O
, O
not O
to O
hurt O
you O
. O

So O
I O
will O
not O
be O
ashamed O
of O
whatever O
boasting O
we O
do O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
think O
that O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
scare O
you O
with O
my O
letters O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
, O
`` O
Paul O
's O
letters O
are O
powerful O
and O
sound O
important O
, O
but O
when O
he O
is O
with O
us O
, O
he O
is O
weak O
and O
the O
worst O
speaker O
you O
have O
ever O
heard O
. O
'' O

Those O
people O
should O
know O
this O
: O
When O
we O
are O
there O
with O
you O
, O
we O
will O
show O
the O
same O
power O
that O
we O
show O
now O
in O
our O
letters O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
dare O
put O
ourselves O
in O
the O
same O
class O
with O
those O
who O
think O
they O
are O
so O
important O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
compare O
ourselves O
to O
them O
. O

They O
use O
themselves O
to O
measure O
themselves O
, O
and O
they O
judge O
themselves O
by O
what O
they O
themselves O
are O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
they O
know O
nothing O
. O

But O
we O
will O
not O
boast O
about O
anything O
outside O
the O
work O
that O
was O
given O
us O
to O
do O
. O

We O
will O
limit O
our O
boasting O
to O
the O
work O
God O
gave O
us O
, O
but O
this O
work O
includes O
our O
work O
with O
you O
. O

We O
would O
be O
boasting O
too O
much O
only O
if O
we O
had O
not O
already O
come O
to O
you O
. O

But O
we O
have O
come O
to O
you O
with O
the O
Good O
News O
of O
Christ O
. O

We O
limit O
our O
boasting O
to O
the O
work O
that O
is O
ours O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
boast O
about O
the O
work O
other O
people O
have O
done O
. O

We O
hope O
that O
your O
faith O
will O
continue O
to O
grow O
. O

We O
hope O
that O
you O
will O
help O
our O
work O
to O
grow O
much O
larger O
. O

We O
want O
to O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
in O
the O
areas O
beyond O
your O
city O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
boast O
about O
work O
that O
has O
already O
been O
done O
in O
someone O
else O
's O
area O

`` O
Whoever O
boasts O
should O
boast O
only O
about O
the O
Lord O
. O
'' O

What O
people O
say O
about O
themselves O
means O
nothing O

What O
counts O
is O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
Lord O
says O
they O
have O
done O
well O

The O
queen O
of O
Sheba O
heard O
about O
Solomon O
, O
so O
she O
came O
to O
test O
him O
with O
hard O
questions O
. O

She O
traveled O
to O
Jerusalem O
with O
a O
very O
large O
group O
of O
servants O
. O

There O
were O
many O
camels O
carrying O
spices O
, O
jewels O
, O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
gold O
. O

She O
met O
Solomon O
and O
asked O
him O
all O
the O
questions O
that O
she O
could O
think O
of O
. O

Solomon O
answered O
all O
the O
questions O
. O

None O
of O
her O
questions O
was O
too O
hard O
for O
him O
to O
explain O
. O

The O
queen O
of O
Sheba O
saw O
that O
Solomon O
was O
very O
wise O
. O

She O
also O
saw O
the O
beautiful O
palace O
he O
had O
built O
. O

She O
saw O
the O
food O
at O
the O
king O
's O
table O
. O

She O
saw O
his O
officials O
meeting O
together O
. O

She O
saw O
the O
servants O
in O
the O
palace O
and O
the O
good O
clothes O
they O
wore O
. O

She O
saw O
his O
parties O
and O
the O
sacrifices O
that O
he O
offered O
in O
the O
Temple O
. O

She O
was O
so O
amazed O
that O
it O
took O
her O
breath O
away O
. O

Then O
she O
said O
to O
King O
Solomon O
, O
`` O
The O
stories O
I O
heard O
in O
my O
country O
about O
your O
great O
works O
and O
your O
wisdom O
are O
true O
. O

I O
did O
not O
believe O
it O
until O
I O
came O
and O
saw O
it O
with O
my O
own O
eyes O
. O

Now O
I O
see O
that O
it O
is O
even O
greater O
than O
what O
I O
heard O
. O

Your O
wealth O
and O
wisdom O
are O
much O
greater O
than O
people O
told O
me O
. O

Your O
wives O
and O
officers O
are O
very O
fortunate O
, O
because O
they O
serve O
you O
and O
hear O
your O
wisdom O
every O
day O
. O

Praise O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
! O

He O
was O
pleased O
to O
make O
you O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
Lord O
's O
unending O
love O
for O
Israel O
, O
he O
has O
made O
you O
king O
to O
rule O
with O
justice O
and O
fairness O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
Queen O
of O
Sheba O
gave O
King O
Solomon O
4 O
1/2 O
tons O
of O
gold O
, O
a O
great O
many O
spices O
, O
and O
valuable O
stones O
. O

She O
gave O
him O
more O
spices O
than O
anyone O
has O
ever O
brought O
into O
Israel O
. O

Hiram O
's O
ships O
brought O
gold O
from O
Ophir O
. O

They O
also O
brought O
jewels O
and O
a O
special O
kind O
of O
wood O
. O

Solomon O
used O
this O
special O
wood O
to O
build O
supports O
in O
the O
Temple O
and O
the O
palace O
as O
well O
as O
harps O
and O
lyres O
for O
the O
singers O
. O

That O
was O
the O
last O
time O
such O
a O
large O
shipment O
of O
that O
kind O
of O
wood O
was O
brought O
to O
Israel O
. O

There O
has O
n't O
been O
any O
seen O
around O
here O
since O
then O
. O

King O
Solomon O
gave O
the O
Queen O
of O
Sheba O
everything O
she O
asked O
for O
. O

He O
gave O
her O
more O
than O
she O
brought O
to O
give O
him O
. O

Then O
the O
Queen O
of O
Sheba O
and O
her O
servants O
left O
and O
went O
back O
to O
their O
own O
country O
. O

Every O
year O
King O
Solomon O
received O
almost O
25 O
tons O
of O
gold O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
gold O
brought O
in O
by O
the O
traveling O
merchants O
and O
traders O
, O
all O
the O
kings O
of O
Arabia O
and O
the O
governors O
of O
the O
land O
also O
brought O
gold O
and O
silver O
to O
Solomon O
. O

King O
Solomon O
made O
200 O
large O
shields O
of O
hammered O
gold O
. O

Each O
shield O
contained O
about O
15 O
pounds O
of O
gold O
. O

He O
also O
made O
300 O
smaller O
shields O
of O
hammered O
gold O
. O

Each O
shield O
contained O
about O
4 O
pounds O
of O
gold O
. O

The O
king O
put O
them O
in O
the O
building O
called O
the O
`` O
Forest O
of O
Lebanon O
. O
'' O

King O
Solomon O
also O
built O
a O
large O
throne O
with O
ivory O
decorations O
. O

It O
was O
covered O
with O
pure O
gold O
. O

There O
were O
six O
steps O
leading O
up O
to O
the O
throne O
. O

The O
back O
of O
the O
throne O
was O
round O
at O
the O
top O
. O

There O
were O
armrests O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
throne O
, O
and O
there O
were O
lions O
in O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
throne O
under O
the O
armrests O
. O

There O
were O
also O
two O
lions O
on O
each O
of O
the O
six O
steps O
, O
one O
at O
each O
end O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
like O
it O
in O
any O
other O
kingdom O
. O

All O
of O
Solomon O
's O
cups O
and O
glasses O
were O
made O
of O
gold O
, O
and O
all O
the O
dishes O
in O
the O
building O
called O
the O
Forest O
of O
Lebanon O
were O
made O
from O
pure O
gold O
. O

Nothing O
in O
the O
palace O
was O
made O
from O
silver O
. O

There O
was O
so O
much O
gold O
that O
in O
Solomon O
's O
time O
people O
did O
not O
think O
silver O
was O
important O
. O

The O
king O
also O
had O
many O
cargo O
ships O
that O
he O
sent O
out O
to O
trade O
things O
with O
other O
countries O
. O

These O
were O
Hiram O
's O
ships O
. O

Every O
three O
years O
the O
ships O
would O
come O
back O
with O
a O
new O
load O
of O
gold O
, O
silver O
, O
ivory O
, O
and O
apes O
and O
baboons O
. O

King O
Solomon O
became O
greater O
in O
riches O
and O
wisdom O
than O
any O
other O
king O
on O
earth O
. O

People O
everywhere O
wanted O
to O
see O
King O
Solomon O
and O
listen O
to O
the O
great O
wisdom O
that O
God O
had O
given O
him O
. O

Every O
year O
people O
came O
to O
see O
the O
king O
and O
brought O
gifts O
made O
from O
gold O
and O
silver O
, O
clothes O
, O
weapons O
, O
spices O
, O
horses O
, O
and O
mules O
. O

Solomon O
had O
a O
great O
number O
of O
chariots O
and O
horses O
. O

He O
had O
1400 O
chariots O
and O
12,000 O
horse O
soldiers O
. O

He O
built O
special O
cities O
for O
these O
chariots O
. O

So O
the O
chariots O
were O
kept O
in O
these O

King O
Solomon O

kept O
some O
of O
the O
chariots O

him O
in O
Jerusalem O

The O
king O
made O
Israel O
very O
rich O

In O
the O
city O
of O
Jerusalem O
, O
silver O
was O
as O
common O
as O
rocks O
and O
cedar O
wood O
was O
as O
common O
as O
the O
many O
fig O
trees O
growing O
on O
the O
hills O

Solomon O
brought O
horses O
from O
Egypt O
and O
Kue O

His O
traders O
bought O
them O
in O
Kue O
and O
brought O
them O
to O
Israel O

A O
chariot O
from O

cost O
about O
15 O
pounds O
of O
silver O
, O
and O
a O
horse O
cost O
almost O
4 O
pounds O
of O
silver O

Solomon O
sold O

kings O

King O
Ben-Hadad O
of O
Aram O
gathered O
his O
army O
together O
. O

There O
were O
32 O
kings O
with O
him O
and O
many O
horses O
and O
chariots O
. O

They O
surrounded O
Samaria O
and O
attacked O
it O
. O

The O
king O
sent O
messengers O
to O
King O
Ahab O
of O
Israel O
who O
was O
inside O
the O
city O
. O

The O
message O
was O
, O
`` O
Ben-Hadad O
says O
, O
' O
Your O
silver O
and O
your O
gold O
are O
mine O
, O
and O
so O
are O
the O
best O
of O
your O
wives O
and O
children O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
king O
of O
Israel O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
my O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
I O
am O
yours O
now O
, O
and O
everything O
I O
have O
belongs O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
messengers O
came O
back O
to O
Ahab O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Ben-Hadad O
says O
, O
' O
I O
told O
you O
before O
that O
all O
of O
your O
silver O
and O
gold O
and O
your O
wives O
and O
children O
belong O
to O
me O
. O

So O
give O
them O
to O
me O
! O

Tomorrow O
I O
will O
send O
my O
men O
to O
search O
through O
your O
house O
and O
through O
the O
houses O
of O
your O
officials O
. O

Give O
my O
men O
all O
of O
your O
valuables O
, O
and O
they O
will O
bring O
them O
back O
to O
me O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
King O
Ahab O
called O
a O
meeting O
of O
all O
the O
elders O
of O
his O
country O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
Ben-Hadad O
is O
looking O
for O
trouble O
. O

First O
he O
told O
me O
that O
I O
must O
give O
him O
my O
wives O
and O
children O
and O
my O
silver O
and O
gold O
. O

I O
agreed O
to O
give O
them O
to O
him O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
elders O
and O
all O
the O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
obey O
him O
or O
do O
what O
he O
says O
. O
'' O

So O
Ahab O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
Ben-Hadad O
that O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
do O
what O
you O
said O
at O
first O
, O
but O
I O
can O
not O
obey O
your O
second O
command O
. O
'' O

King O
Ben-Hadad O
's O
men O
carried O
the O
message O
to O
the O
king O
. O

Then O
they O
came O
back O
with O
another O
message O
from O
Ben-Hadad O
that O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
completely O
destroy O
Samaria O
. O

I O
promise O
that O
there O
will O
be O
nothing O
left O
of O
that O
city O
! O

There O
will O
not O
be O
enough O
of O
that O
city O
left O
for O
my O
men O
to O
find O
any O
souvenirs O
to O
take O
home O
. O

May O
the O
gods O
destroy O
me O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
do O
this O
! O
'' O

King O
Ahab O
answered O
, O
`` O
Tell O
Ben-Hadad O
that O
the O
man O
who O
puts O
on O
his O
armor O
should O
not O
boast O
as O
much O
as O
the O
man O
who O
lives O
long O
enough O
to O
take O
it O
off O
. O
'' O

King O
Ben-Hadad O
was O
drinking O
in O
his O
tent O
with O
the O
other O
rulers O
when O
the O
messengers O
came O
back O
and O
gave O
him O
the O
message O
from O
King O
Ahab O
. O

King O
Ben-Hadad O
commanded O
his O
men O
to O
prepare O
to O
attack O
the O
city O
, O
so O
the O
men O
moved O
into O
their O
places O
for O
the O
battle O
. O

Then O
a O
prophet O
went O
to O
King O
Ahab O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
King O
Ahab O
, O
the O
Lord O
says O
to O
you O
, O
' O
Do O
you O
see O
that O
great O
army O
? O

I O
, O
the O
Lord O
, O
will O
defeat O
that O
army O
for O
you O
today O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
know O
that O
I O
am O
the O
Lord O
. O
' O
'' O

Ahab O
said O
, O
`` O
Who O
will O
you O
use O
to O
defeat O
them O
? O
'' O

The O
prophet O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
says O
, O
' O
The O
young O
men O
who O
carry O
the O
weapons O
for O
the O
government O
officials O
. O
' O
'' O

Then O
the O
king O
asked O
, O
`` O
Who O
should O
command O
the O
main O
army O
? O
'' O

The O
prophet O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
will O
. O
'' O

So O
Ahab O
gathered O
the O
young O
helpers O
of O
the O
government O
officials O
. O

There O
were O
232 O
of O
these O
young O
men O
. O

Then O
the O
king O
called O
together O
the O
army O
of O
Israel O
. O

The O
total O
number O
was O
7000 O
. O

King O
Ahab O
began O
his O
attack O
at O
noon O
, O
while O
King O
Ben-Hadad O
and O
the O
32 O
kings O
were O
drinking O
and O
getting O
drunk O
in O
their O
tents O
. O

The O
young O
helpers O
went O
out O
first O
. O

King O
Ben-Hadad O
's O
men O
told O
him O
that O
some O
soldiers O
had O
come O
out O
of O
Samaria O
. O

So O
Ben-Hadad O
said O
, O
`` O
They O
might O
be O
coming O
to O
fight O
or O
they O
might O
be O
coming O
to O
ask O
for O
peace O
. O

Capture O
them O
alive O
. O
'' O

The O
young O
men O
of O
King O
Ahab O
were O
the O
first O
to O
come O
out O
, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
army O
of O
Israel O
was O
following O
them O
. O

Each O
of O
the O
men O
of O
Israel O
killed O
the O
man O
who O
had O
come O
against O
him O
. O

So O
the O
men O
from O
Aram O
began O
to O
run O
away O
and O
the O
army O
of O
Israel O
chased O
them O
. O

King O
Ben-Hadad O
escaped O
on O
a O
horse O
with O
the O
chariots O
. O

King O
Ahab O
led O
the O
army O
and O
attacked O
all O
the O
horses O
and O
chariots O
. O

So O
King O
Ahab O
made O
the O
Arameans O
suffer O
a O
great O
defeat O
. O

Then O
the O
prophet O
went O
to O
King O
Ahab O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
king O
of O
Aram O
will O
come O
back O
to O
fight O
again O
next O
spring O
. O

So O
go O
back O
and O
strengthen O
your O
army O
and O
make O
careful O
plans O
to O
defend O
yourself O
against O
him O
. O
'' O

King O
Ben-Hadad O
's O
officers O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
The O
gods O
of O
Israel O
are O
mountain O
gods O
. O

We O
fought O
in O
a O
mountain O
area O
, O
so O
the O
Israelites O
won O
. O

If O
we O
fight O
them O
on O
level O
ground O
, O
we O
will O
win O
. O

Also O
, O
do O
n't O
let O
the O
32 O
kings O
command O
the O
armies O
. O

Put O
your O
commanders O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
armies O
. O

Let O
's O
gather O
an O
army O
like O
the O
one O
that O
was O
destroyed O
. O

Gather O
as O
many O
men O
, O
horses O
, O
and O
chariots O
as O
before O
, O
and O
fight O
the O
Israelites O
on O
level O
ground O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
win O
. O
'' O

Ben-Hadad O
followed O
their O
advice O
and O
did O
what O
they O
said O
. O

So O
in O
the O
spring O
, O
Ben-Hadad O
gathered O
the O
men O
of O
Aram O
and O
went O
to O
Aphek O
to O
fight O
against O
Israel O
. O

The O
Israelites O
also O
prepared O
for O
war O
and O
went O
to O
fight O
the O
army O
of O
Aram O
. O

They O
made O
their O
camp O
opposite O
the O
camp O
of O
Aram O
. O

The O
Aramean O
soldiers O
filled O
the O
land O
, O
but O
Israel O
's O
army O
looked O
like O
two O
small O
flocks O
of O
goats O
. O

A O
man O
of O
God O
came O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
with O
this O
message O
: O
`` O
The O
Lord O
said O
, O
' O
The O
people O
of O
Aram O
said O
that O
I O
, O
the O
Lord O
, O
am O
a O
god O
of O
the O
mountains O
and O
not O
a O
god O
of O
the O
valleys O
. O

So O
I O
will O
let O
you O
defeat O
this O
great O
army O
. O

Then O
all O
of O
you O
will O
know O
that O
I O
am O
the O
Lord O
, O
wherever O
you O
are O
! O
' O
'' O

The O
armies O
were O
camped O
across O
from O
each O
other O
for O
seven O
days O
. O

On O
the O
seventh O
day O
the O
battle O
began O
. O

The O
Israelites O
killed O
100,000 O
Aramean O
soldiers O
in O
one O
day O
. O

The O
survivors O
ran O
away O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Aphek O
. O

The O
wall O
of O
the O
city O
fell O
on O
27,000 O
of O
those O
soldiers O
. O

Ben-Hadad O
also O
ran O
away O
to O
the O
city O
and O
hid O
in O
a O
room O
. O

His O
servants O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
We O
heard O
that O
the O
kings O
of O
Israel O
are O
merciful O
. O

Let O
's O
dress O
in O
rough O
cloth O
with O
ropes O
on O
our O
heads O
. O

Then O
let O
's O
go O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Maybe O
he O
will O
let O
us O
live O
. O
'' O

They O
dressed O
in O
rough O
cloth O
with O
ropes O
on O
their O
heads O
. O

They O
came O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Your O
servant O
, O
Ben-Hadad O
, O
says O
, O
' O
Please O
let O
me O
live O
. O
' O
'' O

Ahab O
said O
, O
`` O
Is O
he O
still O
alive O
? O

He O
is O
my O
brother O
. O
'' O

Ben-Hadad O
's O
men O
wanted O
King O
Ahab O
to O
say O
something O
to O
show O
that O
he O
would O
not O
kill O
King O
Ben-Hadad O
. O

When O
Ahab O
called O
Ben-Hadad O
his O
brother O
, O
the O
advisors O
quickly O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
! O

Ben-Hadad O
is O
your O
brother O
. O
'' O

Ahab O
said O
, O
`` O
Bring O
him O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

So O
Ben-Hadad O
came O
to O
King O
Ahab O
. O

King O
Ahab O
asked O
him O
to O
get O
in O
the O
chariot O
with O
him O
. O

Ben-Hadad O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Ahab O
, O
I O
will O
give O
you O
the O
towns O
that O
my O
father O
took O
from O
your O
father O
. O

And O
you O
can O
put O
shops O
in O
Damascus O
, O
as O
my O
father O
did O
in O
Samaria O
. O
'' O

Ahab O
answered O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
agree O
to O
this O
, O
I O
will O
let O
you O
go O
free O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
two O
kings O
made O
a O
peace O
agreement O
. O

Then O
King O
Ahab O
let O
King O
Ben-Hadad O
go O
free O
. O

One O
of O
the O
prophets O
told O
another O
prophet O
, O
`` O
Hit O
me O
! O
'' O

He O
said O
that O
because O
the O
Lord O
had O
commanded O
it O
. O

But O
the O
other O
prophet O
refused O
to O
hit O
him O
. O

So O
the O
first O
prophet O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
did O
not O
obey O
the O
Lord O
's O
command O
. O

So O
a O
lion O
will O
kill O
you O
when O
you O
leave O
this O
place O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
second O
prophet O
left O
, O
a O
lion O
killed O
him O
. O

The O
first O
prophet O
went O
to O
another O
man O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Hit O
me O
! O
'' O

This O
man O
hit O
him O
and O
hurt O
the O
prophet O
. O

So O
the O
prophet O
wrapped O
his O
face O
with O
a O
cloth O
. O

This O
way O
no O
one O
could O
see O
who O
he O
was O
. O

The O
prophet O
went O
and O
waited O
for O
the O
king O
by O
the O
road O
. O

The O
king O
came O
by O
and O
the O
prophet O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
I O
went O
to O
fight O
in O
the O
battle O
. O

One O
of O
our O
men O
brought O
an O
enemy O
soldier O
to O
me O
. O

The O
man O
said O
, O
' O
Guard O
this O
man O
. O

If O
he O
runs O
away O
, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
give O
your O
life O
in O
his O
place O
or O
you O
will O
have O
to O
pay O
a O
fine O
of O
75 O
pounds O
of O
silver O
. O
' O

While O
I O
was O
busy O
doing O
other O
things O
, O
the O
man O
ran O
away O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
of O
Israel O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
admitted O
that O
you O
are O
guilty O
, O
so O
you O
know O
the O
answer O
. O

You O
must O
do O
what O
the O
man O
said O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
prophet O
quickly O
took O
the O
cloth O
from O
his O
face O
, O
and O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
saw O
that O
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O
prophets O
. O

Then O
the O
prophet O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
says O
to O
you O
, O
' O
You O
set O
free O
the O
man O
I O
said O
should O
die O
. O

So O
you O
will O
take O
his O
place O
-- O
you O
and O
your O
people O
will O
die O
! O
' O
'' O

Then O
the O
king O
went O
back O
home O
to O
Samaria O
. O

He O
was O
worried O
and O
upset O
. O




Later O
King O
Nahash O
of O
the O
Ammonites O
died O
. O

His O
son O
Hanun O
became O
the O
new O
king O
after O
him O
. O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
Nahash O
was O
kind O
to O
me O
, O
so O
I O
will O
be O
kind O
to O
his O
son O
Hanun O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
sent O
his O
officers O
to O
comfort O
Hanun O
about O
his O
father O
's O
death O
. O

David O
's O
officers O
went O
to O
the O
land O
of O
the O
Ammonites O
. O

But O
the O
Ammonite O
leaders O
said O
to O
Hanun O
, O
their O
lord O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
think O
that O
David O
is O
trying O
to O
honor O
your O
father O
by O
sending O
some O
men O
to O
comfort O
you O
? O

No O
, O
David O
sent O
these O
men O
to O
spy O
on O
your O
city O
. O

They O
plan O
to O
make O
war O
against O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
Hanun O
took O
David O
's O
officers O
and O
shaved O
off O
one O
half O
of O
their O
beards O
. O

He O
cut O
off O
their O
clothes O
at O
the O
hips O
. O

Then O
he O
sent O
them O
away O
. O

When O
the O
people O
told O
David O
, O
he O
sent O
messengers O
to O
meet O
his O
officers O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
these O
men O
were O
very O
ashamed O
. O

King O
David O
said O
, O
`` O
Wait O
at O
Jericho O
until O
your O
beards O
grow O
again O
. O

Then O
come O
back O
home O
. O
'' O

The O
Ammonites O
saw O
that O
they O
had O
become O
David O
's O
enemies O
, O
so O
they O
hired O
Arameans O
from O
Beth O
Rehob O
and O
Zobah O
. O

There O
were O
20,000 O
Aramean O
foot O
soldiers O
. O

The O
Ammonites O
also O
hired O
the O
king O
of O
Maacah O
with O
1000 O
men O
and O
12,000 O
men O
from O
Tob O
. O

David O
heard O
about O
this O
, O
so O
he O
sent O
Joab O
and O
the O
whole O
army O
of O
powerful O
men O
. O

The O
Ammonites O
came O
out O
and O
got O
ready O
for O
the O
battle O
. O

They O
stood O
at O
the O
city O
gate O
. O

The O
Arameans O
from O
Zobah O
and O
Rehob O
and O
the O
men O
from O
Tob O
and O
Maacah O
did O
not O
stand O
together O
with O
the O
Ammonites O
in O
the O
field O
. O

Joab O
saw O
that O
there O
were O
enemies O
in O
front O
of O
him O
and O
behind O
him O
. O

So O
he O
chose O
some O
of O
the O
best O
Israelite O
soldiers O
and O
lined O
them O
up O
for O
battle O
against O
the O
Arameans O
. O

Then O
Joab O
gave O
the O
other O
men O
to O
his O
brother O
Abishai O
to O
lead O
against O
the O
Ammonites O
. O

Joab O
said O
to O
Abishai O
, O
`` O
If O
the O
Arameans O
are O
too O
strong O
for O
me O
, O
you O
will O
help O
me O
. O

If O
the O
Ammonites O
are O
too O
strong O
for O
you O
, O
I O
will O
come O
and O
help O
you O
. O

Be O
strong O
, O
and O
let O
us O
fight O
bravely O
for O
our O
people O
and O
for O
the O
cities O
of O
our O
God O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
do O
what O
he O
decides O
is O
right O
. O
'' O

Then O
Joab O
and O
his O
men O
attacked O
the O
Arameans O
. O

The O
Arameans O
ran O
away O
from O
Joab O
and O
his O
men O
. O

The O
Ammonites O
saw O
that O
the O
Arameans O
were O
running O
away O
, O
so O
they O
ran O
away O
from O
Abishai O
and O
went O
back O
to O
their O
city O
. O

So O
Joab O
came O
back O
from O
the O
battle O
with O
the O
Ammonites O
and O
went O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

When O
the O
Arameans O
saw O
that O
the O
Israelites O
had O
defeated O
them O
, O
they O
came O
together O
into O
one O
big O
army O
. O

Hadadezer O
sent O
messengers O
to O
bring O
the O
Arameans O
who O
lived O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Euphrates O
River O
. O

These O
Arameans O
came O
to O
Helam O
. O

Their O
leader O
was O
Shobach O
, O
the O
captain O
of O
Hadadezer O
's O
army O
. O

When O
David O
heard O
about O
this O
, O
he O
gathered O
all O
the O
Israelites O
together O
. O

They O
crossed O
over O
the O
Jordan O
River O
and O
went O
to O
Helam O
. O

There O
the O
Arameans O
prepared O
for O
battle O
and O
attacked O
, O
but O
David O
defeated O
them O
, O
and O
they O
ran O
from O
the O
Israelites O
. O

David O
killed O
700 O
chariot O
drivers O
and O
40,000 O
horse O
soldiers O
as O
well O
as O
Shobach O
, O
the O
captain O
of O
the O
Aramean O
army O
. O

The O
kings O
who O
served O
Hadadezer O
saw O
that O
the O
Israelites O
had O
defeated O
them O
, O
so O
they O
made O
peace O
with O
the O
Israelites O
and O
became O
their O
servants O
. O

The O
Arameans O
were O
afraid O
to O
help O
the O
Ammonites O
again O
. O




At O
that O
place O
there O
was O
a O
man O
named O
Sheba O
son O
of O
Bicri O
. O

Sheba O
was O
a O
worthless O
troublemaker O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

He O
blew O
a O
trumpet O
to O
gather O
the O
people O
together O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
no O
share O
in O
David O
. O

We O
have O
no O
part O
in O
the O
son O
of O
Jesse O
. O

Israel O
, O
let O
's O
all O
go O
home O
. O
'' O

So O
all O
the O
Israelites O
left O
David O
and O
followed O
Sheba O
son O
of O
Bicri O
. O

But O
the O
people O
from O
Judah O
stayed O
with O
their O
king O
all O
the O
way O
from O
the O
Jordan O
River O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

David O
went O
back O
to O
his O
house O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
had O
left O
ten O
of O
his O
slave O
women O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
house O
. O

He O
put O
these O
women O
in O
a O
special O
house O
. O

Then O
he O
put O
guards O
around O
the O
house O
. O

They O
stayed O
in O
this O
house O
until O
they O
died O
. O

David O
took O
care O
of O
the O
women O
and O
gave O
them O
food O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
have O
sexual O
relations O
with O
them O
. O

They O
lived O
like O
widows O
until O
they O
died O
. O

The O
king O
told O
Amasa O
, O
`` O
Tell O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
to O
meet O
with O
me O
in O
three O
days O
. O

You O
must O
be O
here O
, O
too O
. O
'' O

So O
Amasa O
called O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
together O
, O
but O
he O
took O
longer O
than O
the O
king O
had O
told O
him O
. O

David O
said O
to O
Abishai O
, O
`` O
Sheba O
son O
of O
Bicri O
is O
more O
dangerous O
to O
us O
than O
Absalom O
was O
. O

So O
take O
my O
officers O
and O
chase O
Sheba O
. O

Hurry O
before O
he O
gets O
into O
cities O
with O
walls O
. O

If O
he O
gets O
into O
the O
well-protected O
cities O
, O
we O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
get O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
Joab O
took O
the O
Kerethites O
and O
Pelethites O
and O
the O
other O
soldiers O
with O
him O
and O
left O
Jerusalem O
to O
chase O
after O
Sheba O
son O
of O
Bicri O
. O

When O
Joab O
and O
the O
army O
came O
to O
Big O
Rock O
at O
Gibeon O
, O
Amasa O
came O
out O
to O
meet O
them O
. O

Joab O
was O
wearing O
his O
uniform O
. O

He O
had O
on O
a O
belt O
, O
and O
his O
sword O
was O
in O
its O
sheath O
. O

As O
he O
was O
walking O
toward O
Amasa O
, O
Joab O
's O
sword O
fell O
out O
of O
its O
sheath O
. O

He O
picked O
up O
the O
sword O
and O
was O
holding O
it O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

Joab O
asked O
Amasa O
, O
`` O
How O
are O
you O
doing O
, O
brother O
? O
'' O

Then O
Joab O
reached O
out O
with O
his O
right O
hand O
and O
grabbed O
Amasa O
by O
the O
beard O
to O
kiss O
him O
hello O
. O

Amasa O
did O
n't O
pay O
any O
attention O
to O
the O
sword O
that O
was O
in O
Joab O
's O
hand O
. O

Joab O
stabbed O
Amasa O
in O
the O
belly O
with O
his O
sword O
. O

Amasa O
's O
intestines O
spilled O
out O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

Joab O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
stab O
him O
again O
-- O
he O
was O
already O
dead O
. O

Then O
Joab O
and O
his O
brother O
Abishai O
resumed O
the O
chase O
after O
Sheba O
son O
of O
Bicri O
. O

One O
of O
Joab O
's O
young O
soldiers O
stood O
by O
Amasa O
's O
body O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
All O
of O
you O
who O
support O
Joab O
and O
David O
, O
let O
's O
follow O
Joab O
. O
'' O

Amasa O
was O
there O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
road O
, O
lying O
in O
his O
own O
blood O
. O

The O
young O
soldier O
noticed O
that O
all O
the O
people O
kept O
stopping O
to O
look O
at O
the O
body O
, O
so O
he O
rolled O
the O
body O
off O
the O
road O
and O
into O
the O
field O
and O
covered O
it O
with O
a O
cloth O
. O

Once O
the O
body O
was O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
the O
people O
simply O
passed O
it O
by O
and O
joined O
up O
with O
Joab O
to O
go O
after O
Sheba O
son O
of O
Bicri O
. O

Sheba O
son O
of O
Bicri O
passed O
through O
all O
the O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
on O
his O
way O
to O
Abel O
Beth O
Maacah O
. O

All O
the O
Berites O
joined O
together O
and O
followed O
Sheba O
. O

When O
Joab O
and O
his O
men O
came O
to O
Abel O
Beth O
Maacah O
, O
they O
surrounded O
the O
town O
. O

They O
piled O
dirt O
up O
against O
the O
city O
wall O
and O
began O
breaking O
stones O
out O
of O
the O
wall O
to O
make O
it O
fall O
down O
. O

But O
there O
was O
a O
very O
wise O
woman O
in O
that O
city O
who O
shouted O
out O
to O
them O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Listen O
to O
me O
! O

Tell O
Joab O
to O
come O
here O
. O

I O
want O
to O
talk O
with O
him O
. O
'' O

Joab O
went O
to O
talk O
with O
the O
woman O
. O

She O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
Joab O
? O
'' O

Joab O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
am O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
Listen O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

Joab O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
listening O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
In O
the O
past O
people O
would O
say O
, O
' O
Ask O
for O
help O
in O
Abel O
and O
you O
will O
get O
what O
you O
need O
. O
' O

I O
am O
one O
of O
many O
peaceful O
, O
loyal O
people O
in O
this O
town O
. O

You O
are O
trying O
to O
destroy O
an O
important O
city O
of O
Israel O
. O

Why O
do O
you O
want O
to O
destroy O
something O
that O
belongs O
to O
the O
Lord O
? O
'' O

Joab O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
destroy O
anything O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
ruin O
your O
city O
. O

But O
there O
is O
a O
man O
in O
your O
city O
from O
the O
hill O
country O
of O
Ephraim O
. O

He O
is O
named O
Sheba O
son O
of O
Bicri O
. O

He O
rebelled O
against O
King O
David O
. O

Bring O
him O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
will O
leave O
the O
city O
alone O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
said O
to O
Joab O
, O
`` O
All O
right O
. O

His O
head O
will O
be O
thrown O
over O
the O
wall O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
woman O
spoke O
very O
wisely O
to O
all O
the O
people O
of O
the O
city O
. O

They O
cut O
off O
the O
head O
of O
Sheba O
son O
of O
Bicri O
and O
threw O
it O
over O
the O
city O
wall O
to O
Joab O
. O

So O
Joab O
blew O
the O
trumpet O
and O
the O
army O
left O
the O
city O
. O

The O
soldiers O
went O
home O
, O
and O
Joab O
went O
back O
to O
the O
king O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

Joab O
was O
captain O
of O
the O
whole O
army O
of O
Israel O
. O

Benaiah O
son O
of O
Jehoiada O
led O
the O
Kerethites O
and O
Pelethites O
. O

Adoniram O
led O
the O
men O
who O
were O
forced O
to O
do O
hard O
work O
. O

Jehoshaphat O
son O
of O
Ahilud O
was O
the O
historian O
. O

Sheva O
was O
the O
secretary O
. O

Zadok O
and O
Abiathar O
were O
the O
priests O
. O

And O
Ira O
from O
Jair O
was O
David O
's O
personal O
priest O
. O




David O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
camps O
at O
Ramah O
and O
went O
to O
Jonathan O
and O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
What O
have O
I O
done O
wrong O
? O

What O
is O
my O
crime O
? O

Why O
is O
your O
father O
trying O
to O
kill O
me O
? O
'' O

Jonathan O
answered O
, O
`` O
That O
ca O
n't O
be O
true O
! O

My O
father O
is O
n't O
trying O
to O
kill O
you O
. O

My O
father O
does O
n't O
do O
anything O
without O
first O
telling O
me O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
matter O
how O
important O
it O
is O
, O
my O
father O
always O
tells O
me O
. O

Why O
would O
my O
father O
refuse O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
he O
wants O
to O
kill O
you O
? O

No O
, O
it O
is O
not O
true O
! O
'' O

But O
David O
answered O
, O
`` O
Your O
father O
knows O
very O
well O
that O
I O
am O
your O
friend O
. O

Your O
father O
said O
to O
himself O
, O
' O
Jonathan O
must O
not O
know O
about O
it O
. O

If O
he O
knows O
, O
he O
will O
tell O
David O
. O
' O

But O
as O
surely O
as O
you O
and O
the O
Lord O
are O
alive O
, O
I O
am O
very O
close O
to O
death O
. O
'' O

Jonathan O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
do O
anything O
you O
want O
me O
to O
do O
. O
'' O

Then O
David O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
tomorrow O
is O
the O
New O
Moon O
celebration O
. O

I O
am O
supposed O
to O
eat O
with O
the O
king O
, O
but O
let O
me O
hide O
in O
the O
field O
until O
the O
evening O
. O

If O
your O
father O
notices O
I O
am O
gone O
, O
tell O
him O
, O
' O
David O
wanted O
to O
go O
home O
to O
Bethlehem O
. O

His O
family O
is O
having O
its O
own O
feast O
for O
this O
monthly O
sacrifice O
. O

David O
asked O
me O
to O
let O
him O
run O
down O
to O
Bethlehem O
and O
join O
his O
family O
. O
' O

If O
your O
father O
says O
, O
' O
Fine O
, O
' O
then O
I O
am O
safe O
. O

But O
if O
your O
father O
becomes O
angry O
, O
you O
will O
know O
that O
he O
wants O
to O
hurt O
me O

Jonathan O
, O
be O
kind O
to O
me O
. O

I O
am O
your O
servant O
. O

You O
have O
made O
an O
agreement O
with O
me O
before O
the O
Lord O
. O

If O
I O
am O
guilty O
, O
you O
may O
kill O
me O
yourself O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
take O
me O
to O
your O
father O
. O
'' O

Jonathan O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
never O
! O

If O
I O
learn O
that O
my O
father O
plans O
to O
hurt O
you O
, O
I O
will O
warn O
you O
. O
'' O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
Who O
will O
warn O
me O
if O
your O
father O
says O
bad O
things O
to O
you O
? O
'' O

Then O
Jonathan O
said O
, O
`` O
Come O
, O
let O
's O
go O
out O
into O
the O
field O
. O
'' O

So O
Jonathan O
and O
David O
went O
together O
into O
the O
field O
. O

Jonathan O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
I O
make O
this O
promise O
before O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
. O

I O
promise O
that O
I O
will O
learn O
how O
my O
father O
feels O
about O
you O
. O

I O
will O
learn O
if O
he O
feels O
good O
about O
you O
or O
not O
. O

Then O
, O
in O
three O
days O
, O
I O
will O
send O
a O
message O
to O
you O
in O
the O
field O
. O

If O
my O
father O
wants O
to O
hurt O
you O
, O
I O
will O
let O
you O
know O
. O

I O
will O
let O
you O
leave O
in O
safety O
. O

May O
the O
Lord O
punish O
me O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
do O
this O
. O

May O
the O
Lord O
be O
with O
you O
as O
he O
has O
been O
with O
my O
father O
. O

As O
long O
as O
I O
live O
, O
show O
me O
the O
same O
kindness O
the O
Lord O
does O
. O

And O
if O
I O
die O
, O
never O
stop O
showing O
this O
kindness O
to O
my O
family O

Be O
faithful O
to O
us O
, O
even O
when O
the O
Lord O
destroys O
all O
your O
enemies O
from O
the O
earth O
. O
'' O

So O
Jonathan O
made O
this O
agreement O
with O
David O
and O
his O
family O
, O
and O
he O
asked O
the O
Lord O
to O
hold O
them O
responsible O
for O
keeping O
it O
. O

Jonathan O
loved O
David O
as O
himself O
, O
and O
because O
of O
this O
love O
, O
he O
asked O
David O
to O
repeat O
this O
agreement O
for O
himself O
. O

Jonathan O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
Tomorrow O
is O
the O
New O
Moon O
celebration O
. O

Your O
seat O
will O
be O
empty O
, O
so O
my O
father O
will O
see O
that O
you O
are O
gone O
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
go O
to O
the O
same O
place O
you O
hid O
when O
this O
trouble O
began O
. O

Wait O
by O
that O
hill O
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
I O
will O
go O
to O
that O
hill O
and O
shoot O
three O
arrows O
as O
if O
I O
am O
shooting O
at O
a O
target O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
tell O
the O
boy O
to O
go O
find O
the O
arrows O
. O

If O
everything O
is O
fine O
, O
I O
will O
tell O
the O
boy O
, O
' O
You O
went O
too O
far O
! O

The O
arrows O
are O
closer O
to O
me O
. O

Come O
back O
and O
get O
them O
. O
' O

If O
I O
say O
that O
, O
you O
can O
come O
out O
of O
hiding O
. O

I O
promise O
, O
as O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
you O
are O
safe O
. O

There O
is O
no O
danger O
. O

But O
if O
there O
is O
trouble O
, O
I O
will O
say O
to O
the O
boy O
, O
' O
The O
arrows O
are O
farther O
away O
. O

Go O
get O
them O
. O
' O

If O
I O
say O
that O
, O
you O
must O
leave O
. O

The O
Lord O
is O
sending O
you O
away O
. O

Remember O
this O
agreement O
between O
you O
and O
me O
. O

The O
Lord O
is O
our O
witness O
forever O
. O
'' O

Then O
David O
hid O
in O
the O
field O
. O

The O
time O
for O
the O
New O
Moon O
celebration O
came O
, O
and O
the O
king O
sat O
down O
to O
eat O
. O

He O
sat O
next O
to O
the O
wall O
where O
he O
usually O
sat O
, O
and O
Jonathan O
sat O
across O
from O
him O
. O

Abner O
sat O
next O
to O
Saul O
, O
but O
David O
's O
place O
was O
empty O
. O

That O
day O
Saul O
said O
nothing O
. O

He O
thought O
, O
`` O
Maybe O
something O
happened O
to O
David O
so O
that O
he O
is O
not O
clean O
. O
'' O

On O
the O
next O
day O
, O
the O
second O
day O
of O
the O
month O
, O
David O
's O
place O
was O
empty O
again O
. O

Then O
Saul O
said O
to O
his O
son O
Jonathan O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
n't O
Jesse O
's O
son O
come O
to O
the O
New O
Moon O
celebration O
yesterday O
or O
today O
? O
'' O

Jonathan O
answered O
, O
`` O
David O
asked O
me O
to O
let O
him O
go O
to O
Bethlehem O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
Let O
me O
go O
. O

Our O
family O
is O
having O
a O
sacrifice O
in O
Bethlehem O
. O

My O
brother O
ordered O
me O
to O
be O
there O
. O

Now O
if O
I O
am O
your O
friend O
, O
please O
let O
me O
go O
and O
see O
my O
brothers O
. O
' O

That O
is O
why O
David O
has O
not O
come O
to O
the O
king O
's O
table O
. O
'' O

Saul O
was O
very O
angry O
with O
Jonathan O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
son O
of O
a O
twisted O
, O
rebellious O
woman O
! O

I O
know O
that O
you O
have O
chosen O
to O
support O
that O
son O
of O
Jesse O
-- O
it O
will O
bring O
shame O
to O
you O
and O
to O
your O
mother O
. O

As O
long O
as O
Jesse O
's O
son O
lives O
, O
you O
will O
never O
be O
king O
and O
have O
a O
kingdom O
. O

Now O
, O
bring O
David O
to O
me O
! O

He O
is O
a O
dead O
man O
. O
'' O

Jonathan O
asked O
his O
father O
, O
`` O
Why O
should O
David O
be O
killed O
? O

What O
did O
he O
do O
wrong O
? O
'' O

But O
Saul O
threw O
his O
spear O
at O
Jonathan O
and O
tried O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

So O
Jonathan O
knew O
that O
his O
father O
wanted O
very O
much O
to O
kill O
David O
. O

Jonathan O
became O
angry O
and O
left O
the O
table O
. O

He O
was O
so O
upset O
and O
angry O
with O
his O
father O
that O
he O
refused O
to O
eat O
any O
food O
on O
the O
second O
day O
of O
the O
festival O
. O

He O
was O
angry O
because O
Saul O
humiliated O
him O
and O
because O
Saul O
wanted O
to O
kill O
David O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
Jonathan O
went O
out O
to O
the O
field O
to O
meet O
David O
as O
they O
had O
agreed O
. O

Jonathan O
brought O
a O
little O
boy O
with O
him O
. O

He O
said O
to O
the O
boy O
, O
`` O
Run O
. O

Go O
find O
the O
arrows O
I O
shoot O
. O
'' O

The O
boy O
began O
to O
run O
, O
and O
Jonathan O
shot O
the O
arrows O
over O
his O
head O
. O

The O
boy O
ran O
to O
the O
place O
where O
the O
arrows O
fell O
, O
but O
Jonathan O
called O
, O
`` O
The O
arrows O
are O
farther O
away O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Hurry O
! O

Go O
get O
them O
. O

Do O
n't O
just O
stand O
there O
. O
'' O

The O
boy O
picked O
up O
the O
arrows O
and O
brought O
them O
back O
to O
his O
master O
. O

The O
boy O
knew O
nothing O
about O
what O
went O
on O
. O

Only O
Jonathan O
and O
David O
knew O
. O

Jonathan O
gave O
his O
bow O
and O
arrows O
to O
the O
boy O
and O
told O
him O
to O
go O
back O
to O
town O
. O

When O
the O
boy O
left O
, O
David O
came O
out O
from O
his O
hiding O
place O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
hill O
. O

David O
gave O
a O
formal O
greeting O
by O
bowing O
to O
the O
ground O
three O
times O
to O
show O
his O
respect O
for O
Jonathan O
. O

But O
then O
David O
and O
Jonathan O
kissed O
each O
other O
and O
cried O
together O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
sad O
goodbye O
, O
especially O
for O
David O
. O

Then O
Jonathan O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
Go O
in O
peace O
. O

We O
have O
taken O
an O
oath O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
name O
to O
be O
friends O
forever O
. O

We O
have O
asked O
the O
Lord O
to O
be O
a O
witness O
between O
us O
and O
our O
descendants O
forever O
. O
'' O




Samuel O
took O
a O
jar O
of O
the O
special O
oil O
and O
poured O
the O
oil O
on O
Saul O
's O
head O
. O

Samuel O
kissed O
Saul O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
has O
anointed O
you O
to O
be O
the O
leader O
over O
the O
people O
who O
belong O
to O
him O
. O

You O
will O
control O
the O
people O
. O

You O
will O
save O
them O
from O
the O
enemies O
that O
are O
all O
around O
them O
. O

He O
has O
anointed O
you O
to O
be O
ruler O
over O
his O
people O
. O

Here O
is O
a O
sign O
that O
will O
prove O
this O
is O
true O
: O
After O
you O
leave O
me O
today O
, O
you O
will O
meet O
two O
men O
near O
Rachel O
's O
tomb O
on O
the O
border O
of O
Benjamin O
at O
Zelzah O
. O

The O
two O
men O
will O
say O
to O
you O
, O
' O
Someone O
found O
the O
donkeys O
you O
were O
looking O
for O
. O

Your O
father O
stopped O
worrying O
about O
his O
donkeys O
. O

Now O
he O
is O
worrying O
about O
you O
. O

He O
is O
saying O
: O
What O
will O
I O
do O
about O
my O
son O
? O
' O
'' O

Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
Then O
you O
will O
go O
until O
you O
come O
to O
the O
large O
oak O
tree O
at O
Tabor O
. O

Three O
men O
will O
meet O
you O
there O
. O

They O
will O
be O
on O
their O
way O
to O
worship O
God O
at O
Bethel O
. O

One O
man O
will O
be O
carrying O
three O
young O
goats O
. O

The O
second O
man O
will O
be O
carrying O
three O
loaves O
of O
bread O
. O

And O
the O
third O
man O
will O
have O
a O
leather O
bag O
full O
of O
wine O
. O

These O
three O
men O
will O
say O
hello O
to O
you O
. O

They O
will O
offer O
you O
two O
loaves O
of O
bread O
, O
and O
you O
will O
accept O
the O
two O
loaves O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
go O
to O
Gibeath O
Elohim O
. O

There O
is O
a O
Philistine O
fort O
in O
that O
place O
. O

When O
you O
come O
to O
this O
town O
, O
a O
group O
of O
prophets O
will O
come O
out O
. O

These O
prophets O
will O
come O
down O
from O
the O
place O
for O
worship O
. O

They O
will O
be O
prophesying O
. O

They O
will O
be O
playing O
harps O
, O
tambourines O
, O
flutes O
, O
and O
lyres O
. O

Then O
the O
Lord O
's O
Spirit O
will O
come O
on O
you O
with O
great O
power O
. O

You O
will O
be O
changed O
. O

You O
will O
be O
like O
a O
different O
man O
. O

You O
will O
begin O
to O
prophesy O
with O
these O
prophets O
. O

After O
that O
happens O
, O
you O
can O
do O
whatever O
you O
choose O
to O
do O
, O
because O
God O
will O
be O
with O
you O

`` O
Go O
to O
Gilgal O
before O
me O

Then O
I O
will O
come O
there O
to O
you O

And O
I O
will O
offer O
burnt O
offerings O
and O

But O
you O
must O
wait O
seven O
days O

Then O
I O

tell O
you O
what O
to O
do O

'' O

Just O
as O
Saul O
turned O
to O
leave O
Samuel O
, O
God O
turned O
Saul O
's O
life O
around O
. O

All O
these O
things O
happened O
that O
day O
. O

When O
Saul O
and O
his O
servant O
came O
to O
Gibeath O
Elohim O
, O
Saul O
met O
a O
group O
of O
prophets O
. O

God O
's O
Spirit O
came O
on O
Saul O
with O
great O
power O
, O
and O
Saul O
prophesied O
with O
the O
prophets O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
people O
who O
had O
known O
Saul O
before O
saw O
him O
prophesying O
with O
the O
prophets O
. O

So O
they O
asked O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
What O
has O
happened O
to O
Kish O
's O
son O
? O

Is O
Saul O
also O
one O
the O
prophets O
? O
'' O

A O
man O
living O
in O
Gibeath O
Elohim O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
that O
he O
is O
their O
leader O
. O
'' O

That O
is O
why O
this O
became O
a O
famous O
saying O
: O
`` O
Is O
Saul O
also O
one O
of O
the O
prophets O
? O
'' O

After O
Saul O
finished O
prophesying O
, O
he O
went O
to O
the O
place O
of O
worship O
. O

Saul O
's O
uncle O
asked O
Saul O
and O
his O
servant O
, O
`` O
Where O
have O
you O
been O
? O
'' O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
were O
looking O
for O
the O
donkeys O
. O

When O
we O
could O
n't O
find O
them O
, O
we O
went O
to O
see O
Samuel O

'' O

Saul O
's O
uncle O
said O
, O
`` O
Please O
tell O
me O
, O
what O
did O
Samuel O
say O
to O
you O
? O
'' O

Saul O
answered O
, O
`` O
Samuel O
told O
us O
the O
donkeys O
were O
already O
found O

'' O

He O
did O
not O
tell O
his O
uncle O
everything O
. O

Saul O
did O
not O
tell O
him O
what O
Samuel O
said O
about O
the O
kingdom O
. O

Samuel O
told O
all O
the O
Israelites O
to O
meet O
together O
with O
the O
Lord O
at O
Mizpah O
. O

Samuel O
told O
the O
Israelites O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
says O
, O
' O
I O
led O
Israel O
out O
of O
Egypt O

I O
saved O
you O
from O
Egypt O

control O
and O
from O
the O
other O
kingdoms O
that O
tried O
to O
hurt O
you O
. O
' O

But O
today O
you O
have O
rejected O
your O
God O
. O

Your O
God O
saves O
you O
from O
all O
your O
troubles O
and O
problems O
. O

But O
you O
said O
, O
' O
No O
, O
we O
want O
a O
king O
to O
rule O
us O
. O
' O

Now O
come O
, O
stand O
before O
the O
Lord O
in O
your O
family O
groups O
and O
tribes O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
brought O
all O
the O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
near O
. O

Then O
Samuel O
began O
to O
choose O
the O
new O
king O
. O

First O
, O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
was O
chosen O
. O

Samuel O
told O
each O
family O
in O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
to O
pass O
by O
. O

Matri O
's O
family O
was O
chosen O
. O

Then O
Samuel O
told O
each O
man O
in O
Matri O
's O
family O
to O
walk O
by O
. O

Saul O
son O
of O
Kish O
was O
chosen O
. O

But O
when O
the O
people O
looked O
for O
Saul O
, O
they O
could O
not O
find O
him O
. O

Then O
they O
asked O
the O
Lord O
, O
`` O
Has O
Saul O
come O
here O
yet O
? O
'' O

The O
Lord O
said O
, O
`` O
Saul O
is O
hiding O
behind O
the O
supplies O
. O
'' O

The O
people O
ran O
and O
took O
Saul O
out O
from O
behind O
the O
supplies O
. O

Saul O
stood O
up O
among O
the O
people O
. O

He O
was O
a O
head O
taller O
than O
anyone O
else O
. O

Samuel O
said O
to O
all O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
See O
the O
man O
the O
Lord O
has O
chosen O

There O
is O
no O
one O
like O
Saul O
among O
the O
people O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
people O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Long O
live O
the O
king O
! O
'' O

Samuel O
explained O
the O
rules O
of O
the O
kingdom O
to O
the O
people O
. O

He O
wrote O
the O
rules O
in O
a O
book O
and O
put O
the O
book O
before O
the O
Lord O
. O

Then O
Samuel O
told O
the O
people O
to O
go O
home O
. O

Saul O
also O
went O
to O
his O
home O
in O
Gibeah O
. O

God O
touched O
the O
hearts O
of O
brave O
men O
who O
then O
began O
to O
follow O
Saul O
. O

But O
some O
troublemakers O
said O
, O
`` O
How O
can O
this O
man O
save O
us O
? O
'' O

They O
said O
bad O
things O
about O
Saul O
and O
refused O
to O
bring O
gifts O
to O
him O
. O

But O
Saul O
said O
nothing O
. O

King O
Nahash O
of O
the O
Ammonites O
had O
been O
hurting O
the O
tribes O
of O
Gad O
and O
Reuben O
. O

Nahash O
poked O
out O
the O
right O
eye O
of O
each O
of O
the O
men O
and O
did O
not O
allow O
anyone O
to O
help O
them O
. O

He O
poked O
out O
the O
right O
eye O
of O
every O
Israelite O
man O
living O
in O
the O
area O
east O
of O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

But O
7000 O
Israelite O
men O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
Ammonites O
and O
came O
to O
Jabesh O
Gilead O
. O




As O
soon O
as O
David O
and O
his O
men O
arrived O
at O
Ziklag O
on O
the O
third O
day O
, O
they O
saw O
that O
the O
Amalekites O
had O
attacked O
Ziklag O
. O

The O
Amalekites O
invaded O
the O
Negev O
area O
, O
attacked O
Ziklag O
, O
and O
burned O
the O
city O

They O
took O
all O
the O
women O
in O
Ziklag O
, O
both O
young O
and O
old O
, O
as O
prisoners O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
kill O
anyone O
; O
they O
only O
took O
them O
as O
prisoners O

When O
David O
and O
his O
men O
came O
to O
Ziklag O
, O
they O
found O
the O
city O
burning O
. O

Their O
wives O
, O
sons O
, O
and O
daughters O
were O
all O
gone O
. O

The O
Amalekites O
had O
taken O
them O

David O
and O
the O
other O
men O
in O
his O
army O
cried O
loudly O
until O
they O
were O
too O
weak O
to O
cry O
anymore O
. O

The O
Amalekites O
had O
taken O
David O
's O
two O
wives O
, O
Ahinoam O
of O
Jezreel O
and O
Abigail O
, O
who O
had O
been O
the O
wife O
of O
Nabal O
from O
Carmel O
. O

All O
the O
men O
in O
the O
army O
were O
sad O
and O
angry O
because O
their O
sons O
and O
daughters O
were O
taken O
as O
prisoners O
. O

The O
men O
were O
talking O
about O
killing O
David O
with O
stones O
. O

This O
upset O
David O
very O
much O
, O
but O
he O
found O
strength O
in O
the O
Lord O
his O
God O
. O

David O
said O
to O
Abiathar O
the O
priest O
, O
`` O
Bring O
the O
ephod O
. O
'' O

Then O
David O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

`` O
Should O
I O
chase O
the O
people O
who O
took O
our O
families O
? O

Will O
I O
catch O
them O
? O
'' O

The O
Lord O
answered O
, O
`` O
Chase O
them O
. O

You O
will O
catch O
them O
, O
and O
you O
will O
save O
your O
families O
. O
'' O

David O
took O
the O
600 O
men O
with O
him O
and O
went O
to O
Besor O
Ravine O
. O

About O
200 O
of O
his O
men O
stayed O
there O
because O
they O
were O
too O
weak O
and O
tired O
to O
continue O
. O

But O
David O
and O
the O
other O
400 O
men O
continued O
to O
chase O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

David O
's O
men O
found O
an O
Egyptian O
in O
a O
field O
and O
took O
him O
to O
David O
. O

They O
gave O
the O
Egyptian O
some O
water O
to O
drink O
and O
some O
food O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
Egyptian O
had O
not O
had O
any O
food O
or O
water O
for O
three O
days O
and O
nights O
, O
so O
they O
gave O
him O
a O
piece O
of O
fig O
cake O
and O
two O
clusters O
of O
raisins O
. O

He O
felt O
better O
after O
eating O
. O

David O
asked O
the O
Egyptian O
, O
`` O
Who O
is O
your O
master O
? O

Where O
do O
you O
come O
from O
? O
'' O

The O
Egyptian O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
an O
Egyptian O
, O
the O
slave O
of O
an O
Amalekite O
. O

Three O
days O
ago O
I O
got O
sick O
, O
and O
my O
master O
left O
me O
behind O
. O

We O
had O
attacked O
the O
Negev O
area O
where O
the O
Kerethites O
live O
. O

We O
also O
attacked O
Judah O
and O
the O
Negev O
area O
where O
Caleb O
's O
people O
live O
. O

We O
burned O
Ziklag O
. O
'' O

David O
asked O
the O
Egyptian O
, O
`` O
Will O
you O
lead O
me O
to O
the O
people O
who O
took O
our O
families O
? O
'' O

The O
Egyptian O
answered O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
make O
a O
special O
promise O
before O
God O
, O
I O
will O
help O
you O
find O
them O
. O

But O
you O
must O
promise O
that O
you O
will O
not O
kill O
me O
or O
give O
me O
back O
to O
my O
master O
. O
'' O

The O
Egyptian O
led O
David O
to O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

They O
were O
lying O
around O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
eating O
and O
drinking O
. O

They O
were O
celebrating O
with O
the O
many O
things O
they O
had O
taken O
from O
the O
Philistines O
and O
from O
Judah O
. O

David O
attacked O
them O
and O
killed O
them O
. O

They O
fought O
from O
sunrise O
until O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
next O
day O
. O

None O
of O
the O
Amalekites O
escaped O
, O
except O
for O
400 O
young O
men O
who O
jumped O
onto O
their O
camels O
and O
rode O
away O
. O

David O
got O
back O
everything O
the O
Amalekites O
had O
taken O
, O
including O
his O
two O
wives O
. O

Nothing O
was O
missing O
. O

They O
found O
all O
the O
children O
and O
old O
people O
, O
all O
their O
sons O
and O
daughters O
, O
and O
all O
their O
valuables O
. O

They O
got O
back O
everything O
the O
Amalekites O
had O
taken O
. O

David O
brought O
everything O
back O
. O

He O
took O
all O
the O
sheep O
and O
cattle O
. O

His O
men O
led O
these O
animals O
to O
the O
front O
of O
the O
group O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
David O
's O
prize O
. O
'' O

David O
came O
to O
the O
200 O
men O
who O
had O
stayed O
at O
Besor O
Ravine O
. O

These O
were O
the O
men O
who O
were O
too O
weak O
and O
tired O
to O
follow O
David O
. O

They O
came O
out O
to O
meet O
him O
and O
the O
soldiers O
who O
went O
with O
him O
. O

They O
greeted O
David O
and O
his O
army O
as O
they O
approached O
. O

There O
were O
some O
troublemakers O
in O
the O
group O
who O
went O
with O
David O
who O
started O
complaining O
, O
`` O
These O
200 O
men O
did O
n't O
go O
with O
us O
, O
so O
we O
why O
should O
we O
give O
them O
any O
of O
the O
things O
we O
took O
. O

These O
men O
get O
nothing O
but O
their O
own O
wives O
and O
children O
. O
'' O

David O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
my O
brothers O
. O

Do O
n't O
do O
that O
! O

Think O
about O
what O
the O
Lord O
gave O
us O
. O

He O
let O
us O
defeat O
the O
enemy O
that O
attacked O
us O
. O

No O
one O
will O
listen O
to O
what O
you O
say O
. O

The O
share O
will O
be O
the O
same O
for O
the O
man O
who O
stayed O
with O
the O
supplies O
and O
for O
the O
man O
who O
went O
into O
battle O
. O

Everyone O
will O
share O
alike O
. O
'' O

David O
made O
this O
an O
order O
and O
rule O
for O
Israel O
. O

This O
rule O
continues O
even O
today O
. O

When O
David O
got O
to O
Ziklag O
, O
he O
sent O
some O
of O
the O
things O
he O
took O
from O
the O
Amalekites O
to O
his O
friends O
, O
the O
leaders O
of O
Judah O
. O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
Here O
is O
a O
present O
for O
you O
that O
we O
took O
from O
the O
Lord O
's O
enemies O
. O
'' O

David O
sent O
some O
of O
the O
gifts O
to O
the O
leaders O
in O
Bethel O
, O
Ramoth O
in O
the O
Negev O
, O
Jattir O
, O
Aroer O
, O
Siphmoth O
, O
Eshtemoa O
, O
Racal O
, O
the O
cities O
of O
the O
Jerahmeelites O
and O
the O
cities O
of O
the O
Kenites O
, O
Hormah O
, O
Bor O
Ashan O
, O
Athach O
, O
and O
Hebron O
, O
and O
to O
all O
the O
other O
places O
where O
David O
and O
his O
men O
had O
stayed O
. O




At O
that O
time O
Hezekiah O
became O
sick O
and O
almost O
died O
. O

The O
prophet O
Isaiah O
son O
of O
Amoz O
went O
to O
see O
him O
and O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
says O
, O
' O
You O
will O
die O
soon O
, O
so O
you O
should O
tell O
your O
family O
what O
they O
should O
do O
when O
you O
die O
. O

You O
will O
not O
get O
well O
. O
' O
'' O

Hezekiah O
turned O
his O
face O
to O
the O
wall O
that O
faced O
the O
Temple O
and O
began O
praying O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

`` O
Lord O
, O
remember O
that O
I O
have O
sincerely O
served O
you O
with O
all O
my O
heart O
. O

I O
have O
done O
what O
you O
say O
is O
good O
. O
'' O

Then O
Hezekiah O
cried O
very O
hard O
. O

Before O
Isaiah O
had O
left O
the O
middle O
courtyard O
, O
he O
received O
this O
message O
from O
the O
Lord O
, O
`` O
Go O
back O
and O
speak O
to O
Hezekiah O
, O
the O
leader O
of O
my O
people O
. O

Tell O
him O
, O
' O
The O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
your O
ancestor O
David O
, O
says O
: O
I O
heard O
your O
prayer O
and O
I O
saw O
your O
tears O
, O
so O
I O
will O
heal O
you O
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
you O
will O
go O
up O
to O
the O
Temple O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

I O
will O
add O
15 O
years O
to O
your O
life O
. O

I O
will O
save O
you O
and O
this O
city O
from O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
. O

I O
will O
protect O
this O
city O
. O

I O
will O
do O
this O
for O
myself O
and O
because O
of O
the O
promise O
I O
made O
to O
my O
servant O
David O
. O
' O
'' O

Then O
Isaiah O
said O
, O
`` O
Crush O
figs O
together O
and O
put O
them O
on O
your O
sore O
; O
you O
will O
get O
well O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
took O
the O
mixture O
of O
figs O
and O
put O
it O
on O
Hezekiah O
's O
sore O
, O
and O
he O
got O
well O
. O

Hezekiah O
asked O
Isaiah O
, O
`` O
What O
will O
be O
the O
sign O
that O
the O
Lord O
will O
heal O
me O
, O
and O
that O
I O
will O
go O
up O
to O
the O
Temple O
of O
the O
Lord O
on O
the O
third O
day O
? O
'' O

Isaiah O
said O
, O
`` O
Which O
do O
you O
want O
? O

Should O
the O
shadow O
go O
forward O
ten O
steps O
or O
go O
back O
ten O
steps O
? O

This O
is O
the O
sign O
for O
you O
from O
the O
Lord O
to O
show O
that O
the O
Lord O
will O
do O
what O
he O
said O
he O
would O
do O
. O
'' O

Hezekiah O
answered O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
an O
easy O
thing O
for O
the O
shadow O
to O
go O
down O
ten O
steps O
. O

No O
, O
make O
the O
shadow O
go O
back O
ten O
steps O
. O
'' O

Then O
Isaiah O
prayed O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
made O
the O
shadow O
move O
back O
ten O
steps O
. O

It O
went O
back O
up O
the O
steps O
that O
it O
had O
already O
been O
on O
. O

At O
that O
time O
Merodach O
Baladan O
son O
of O
Baladan O
was O
king O
of O
Babylon O
. O

He O
sent O
letters O
and O
a O
gift O
to O
Hezekiah O
when O
he O
heard O
that O
Hezekiah O
had O
been O
sick O
. O

Hezekiah O
listened O
to O
the O
messengers O
and O
then O
showed O
them O
all O
the O
valuable O
things O
he O
owned O
. O

He O
showed O
them O
the O
silver O
, O
the O
gold O
, O
the O
spices O
, O
the O
expensive O
perfume O
, O
and O
the O
building O
where O
he O
stored O
the O
weapons O

He O
showed O
them O
everything O
in O
his O
treasuries O
, O
in O
his O
palace O
, O
and O
in O
his O
kingdom O
. O

Then O
Isaiah O
the O
prophet O
came O
to O
King O
Hezekiah O
and O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
What O
did O
these O
men O
say O
? O

Where O
did O
they O
come O
from O
? O
'' O

Hezekiah O
said O
, O
`` O
These O
men O
came O
from O
a O
faraway O
country O
, O
from O
Babylon O
. O
'' O

Isaiah O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
did O
they O
see O
in O
your O
palace O
? O
'' O

Hezekiah O
answered O
, O
`` O
They O
saw O
everything O
I O
own O

I O
showed O
them O
all O
my O
wealth O

Then O
Isaiah O
said O
to O
Hezekiah O
, O
`` O
Listen O

this O

The O
time O

when O
everything O

palace O
and O
everything O
your O

have O
saved O
until O
today O
will O
be O
carried O
away O
to O
Babylon O

Nothing O
will O
be O
left O

The O
Lord O
said O
this O

The O
Babylonians O
will O
take O
your O
sons O

and O
your O
sons O
will O
become O
officers O
in O
the O
palace O
of O
the O
king O

Babylon O

'' O

Then O
Hezekiah O
told O
Isaiah O
, O
`` O
This O
message O
from O
the O
Lord O
is O
good O

'' O

-LRB- O
Hezekiah O
said O
this O
because O
he O
thought O

`` O
There O

real O
peace O

during O
my O
lifetime O

-RRB- O

All O
the O
great O
things O
that O
Hezekiah O
did O
, O
including O
his O
work O
on O
the O

the O
aqueduct O

Hezekiah O
died O

with O
his O

And O
his O
son O
Manasseh O
became O
the O
new O
king O
after O
him O

Ahab O
had O
70 O
sons O
in O
Samaria O
. O

Jehu O
wrote O
letters O
and O
sent O
them O
to O
Samaria O
to O
the O
rulers O
and O
leaders O
of O
Jezreel O
. O

He O
also O
sent O
the O
letters O
to O
the O
people O
who O
raised O
Ahab O

sons O
saying O
, O
`` O
As O
soon O
as O
you O
get O
this O
letter O

choose O
the O
one O

is O
the O

most O
worthy O
among O
your O
master O

You O

And O
you O
are O

Then O
fight O
for O
your O
master O

family O

'' O

But O
the O
rulers O
and O
leaders O
of O
Jezreel O
were O
very O
afraid O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
two O
kings O
could O
not O
stop O
Jehu O

So O
we O
can O
not O
stop O

The O
palace O
manager O

the O
official O
in O

of O
the O
city O
, O
the O
elders O
, O
and O
the O
people O
who O
raised O
the O
king O

sent O
a O

Jehu O

`` O

you O

Then O
Jehu O
wrote O
a O
second O
letter O
to O
these O
leaders O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O

Ahab O
had O
70 O
sons O

They O
were O
with O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
city O
who O
raised O
them O

When O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
city O
received O
the O
letter O
, O
they O
took O
the O
king O
's O
sons O
and O
killed O
all O
70 O
of O
them O

Then O
the O
leaders O
put O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
king O

sons O
in O
baskets O
and O
sent O
the O
baskets O
to O
Jehu O
at O
Jezreel O

The O
messenger O
came O
to O
Jehu O

told O
him O
, O
`` O
They O

`` O

In O
the O
morning O
Jehu O
went O
out O
and O
stood O
before O
the O
people O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
innocent O

all O

You O

You O
should O

The O

Now O

done O
what O
he O
said O
he O
would O
do O
. O
'' O

So O
Jehu O
killed O
all O
the O
people O
in O
Ahab O
's O
family O
living O
in O
Jezreel O
. O

He O
killed O
all O
the O
important O
men O
, O
close O
friends O
, O
and O
priests O
. O

None O
of O
Ahab O
's O
people O
were O
left O
alive O
. O

Jehu O
left O
Jezreel O
and O
went O
to O
Samaria O
. O

On O
the O
way O
he O
stopped O
at O
a O
place O
called O
Shepherd O
's O
Camp O
. O

There O
he O
met O
with O
the O
relatives O
of O
King O
Ahaziah O
of O
Judah O
. O

Jehu O
asked O
, O
`` O
Who O
are O
you O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
are O
the O
relatives O
of O
King O
Ahaziah O
of O
Judah O
. O

We O
have O
come O
down O
to O
visit O
the O
king O
's O
children O
and O
the O
queen O
mother O
's O
children O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jehu O
said O
, O
`` O
Take O
them O
alive O
! O
'' O

Jehu O
's O
men O
captured O
Ahaziah O
's O
relatives O
alive O
. O

There O
were O
42 O
of O
them O
. O

Jehu O
killed O
them O
at O
the O
well O
near O
Beth O
Eked O
. O

He O
did O
not O
leave O
anyone O
alive O
. O

After O
Jehu O
left O
there O
, O
he O
met O
Jehonadab O
son O
of O
Recab O
. O

Jehonadab O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
meet O
Jehu O
. O

Jehu O
greeted O
Jehonadab O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
a O
faithful O
friend O
to O
me O
, O
as O
I O
am O
to O
you O
? O
'' O

Jehonadab O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
am O
a O
faithful O
friend O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

Jehu O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
are O
, O
give O
me O
your O
hand O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jehu O
reached O
out O
and O
pulled O
Jehonadab O
up O
into O
the O
chariot O
. O

Jehu O
said O
, O
`` O
Come O
with O
me O
. O

You O
can O
see O
how O
strong O
my O
feelings O
are O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O
'' O

So O
Jehonadab O
rode O
in O
Jehu O
's O
chariot O
. O

Jehu O
came O
to O
Samaria O
and O
killed O
all O
Ahab O
's O
family O
who O
were O
still O
alive O
in O
Samaria O
. O

He O
killed O
them O
all O
. O

He O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
had O
told O
Elijah O
. O

Then O
Jehu O
gathered O
all O
the O
people O
together O
and O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Ahab O
served O
Baal O
a O
little O
, O
but O
Jehu O
will O
serve O
Baal O
much O
. O

Now O
call O
together O
all O
the O
priests O
and O
prophets O
of O
Baal O
. O

And O
call O
together O
everyone O
who O
worships O
Baal O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
miss O
this O
meeting O
. O

I O
have O
a O
great O
sacrifice O
to O
give O
to O
Baal O
. O

I O
will O
kill O
anyone O
who O
does O
not O
come O
to O
this O
meeting O
. O
'' O

But O
Jehu O
was O
tricking O
them O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
destroy O
the O
worshipers O
of O
Baal O
. O

Jehu O
said O
, O
`` O
Prepare O
a O
holy O
meeting O
for O
Baal O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
priests O
announced O
the O
meeting O
. O

Then O
Jehu O
sent O
a O
message O
through O
all O
the O
land O
of O
Israel O
. O

All O
the O
worshipers O
of O
Baal O
came O
. O

Not O
one O
stayed O
home O
. O

The O
Baal O
worshipers O
came O
into O
the O
temple O
of O
Baal O
. O

The O
temple O
was O
filled O
with O
people O
. O

Jehu O
said O
to O
the O
man O
who O
kept O
the O
robes O
, O
`` O
Bring O
out O
the O
robes O
for O
all O
the O
worshipers O
of O
Baal O
. O
'' O

So O
that O
man O
brought O
out O
the O
robes O
for O
the O
Baal O
worshipers O
. O

Then O
Jehu O
and O
Jehonadab O
son O
of O
Recab O
went O
into O
the O
temple O
of O
Baal O
. O

Jehu O
said O
to O
the O
worshipers O
of O
Baal O
, O
`` O
Look O
around O
and O
be O
sure O
that O
there O
are O
no O
servants O
of O
the O
Lord O
with O
you O
. O

Be O
sure O
there O
are O
only O
people O
who O
worship O
Baal O
. O
'' O

The O
worshipers O
of O
Baal O
went O
into O
the O
temple O
of O
Baal O
to O
offer O
sacrifices O
and O
burnt O
offerings O
. O

But O
outside O
, O
Jehu O
had O
80 O
men O
waiting O
. O

He O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
escape O
. O

If O
any O
man O
lets O
one O
person O
escape O
, O
that O
man O
must O
pay O
with O
his O
own O
life O
. O
'' O

Quickly O
after O
Jehu O
had O
finished O
offering O
the O
burnt O
offering O
, O
he O
said O
to O
the O
guards O
and O
to O
the O
captains O
, O
`` O
Go O
in O
and O
kill O
the O
worshipers O
of O
Baal O
! O

Do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
come O
out O
of O
the O
temple O
alive O
! O
'' O

So O
the O
captains O
used O
thin O
swords O
and O
killed O
the O
worshipers O
of O
Baal O
. O

They O
threw O
the O
bodies O
of O
the O
worshipers O
of O
Baal O
out O
. O

Then O
the O
guards O
and O
the O
captains O
went O
to O
the O
inner O
room O
of O
the O
temple O
of O
Baal O
. O

They O
brought O
out O
the O
memorial O
stones O
that O
were O
in O
the O
temple O
of O
Baal O
and O
burned O
that O
temple O
. O

Then O
they O
smashed O
the O
memorial O
stones O
of O
Baal O
. O

They O
also O
smashed O
the O
temple O
of O
Baal O
. O

They O
made O
the O
temple O
of O
Baal O
into O
a O
public O
toilet O
, O
which O
is O
still O
used O
today O
. O

So O
Jehu O
destroyed O
Baal O
worship O
in O
Israel O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
completely O
turn O
away O
from O
the O
sins O
of O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
that O
caused O
Israel O
to O
sin O
. O

Jehu O
did O
not O
destroy O
the O
golden O
calves O
in O
Bethel O
and O
in O
Dan O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
Jehu O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
done O
well O
. O

You O
have O
done O
what O
I O
say O
is O
good O
. O

You O
destroyed O
Ahab O
's O
family O
the O
way O
I O
wanted O
you O
to O
, O
so O
your O
descendants O
will O
rule O
Israel O
for O
four O
generations O
. O
'' O

But O
Jehu O
was O
not O
careful O
to O
follow O
the O
law O
of O
the O
Lord O
with O
all O
his O
heart O
. O

Jehu O
did O
not O
stop O
committing O
the O
sins O
of O
Jeroboam O
that O
caused O
Israel O
to O
sin O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
Lord O
began O
to O
cut O
away O
sections O
of O
Israel O
and O
give O
them O
to O
other O
nations O
. O

King O
Hazael O
of O
Aram O
defeated O
the O
Israelites O
on O
every O
border O
of O
Israel O
. O

He O
won O
the O
land O
east O
of O
the O
Jordan O
River O
-- O
all O
the O
land O
of O
Gilead O
, O
including O
the O
land O
that O
belonged O
to O
the O

He O
won O
all O
the O
land O
from O
Aroer O
by O
the O
Arnon O
Valley O
to O
Gilead O

Bashan O
. O

All O
the O
other O

things O
that O
Jehu O
did O
are O
written O
in O
the O
book O

The O
History O

Jehu O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
with O
his O
ancestors O
. O

The O
people O
buried O
him O
in O
Samaria O
. O

His O
son O
Jehoahaz O
became O
the O

him O

Jehu O

28 O

Mr. O

that O

only O
two B-MISC
options O
for O
achieving O
financial O
stability O

He O
can O
either O

adopt O
the O
German B-MISC

the B-LOC
Yugoslav I-LOC
Republic I-LOC

or O
, O
Mr. O

can O
adopt O

a O

if O

move O

decisively O
within O

of O

the O

slim O

Mr. O

says O
it O

essential O
that O
President O
Kostunica B-PER
embrace O
the O
principle O
of O
sound O
money O

something O
Mr. O

believes O
is O
as O
important O

the O
rule O

Last B-MISC

, O
the O

bringing O
it O

30 B-MISC

the O

, O
compared O
to O
the O
previous O
official O
rate O
of O
20 B-MISC

Mr. O
Hanky B-PER
, O
who O
regards O
the O
dinar O
as O
the O
world O

worst O
currency O
, O
says O
the O
deutsch O

is O
becoming O
the O
de O

money O
in O
the O
entire O
Balkan B-MISC
region O
. O

If O
they O
use O
the O
d O
mark O
in O
Serbia B-LOC
, O
obviously O
there O
would O
be O
essentially O
the O
same O
system O
that O
they O
have O
in O

if O
they O
had O
a O
currency O

with O
a O

the O
thing O
, O
like O
Bosnia B-LOC
, O
it O
would O
essentially O
mean O
that O
they O
had O
a O
unified O
system O
was O
what O
they O
have O
in O
Montenegro B-LOC
because O
with O
Montenegro B-LOC
, O
they O
would O
still O
have O
the O

, O
but O
they O
would O
also O
use O
this O
new O

there O
would O
be O
absolutely O
no O
problem O
, O
and O
furthermore O
, O
from O
a O
regional O
point O
of O
view O
, O
you O
'd O
have O
essentially O
most O
of O
the O
Balkans B-MISC
in O
a O

because O
Bulgaria B-LOC

a O

Good O
evening B-MISC

That O
call O
to O

you O
just O
heard O
reverberates O
through O
the B-MISC
Supreme I-MISC

every B-MISC
day I-MISC
that O
the O
justices O
convene O
, O
but O
today B-MISC
was O
no O
everyday O
session O
. O

Never O
before O
has O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
States I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
taken O
up O
a O
case O
that O
could O
decide O
a O
presidential O
election O
. O

It O
did O
today O
. O

That O
session O
of O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
and O
two B-MISC
defeats O
for O
Al B-PER
Gore I-PER
in O
Florida B-LOC
courts O
dominate O
the O
news O
today B-MISC
. O

We O
start O
with O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
, O
specifically O
at O
issue O
, O
an O
appeal O
from O
the O
campaign O
of O
George B-PER
W. I-PER
Bush I-PER
that O
the B-ORG
Florida I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
had O
exceeded O
its O
authority O
when O
it O
ruled O
Florida B-LOC
counties O
could O
have O
more O
time O
to O
hand O
- O
count O

. O

Throughout O
an B-MISC
hour I-MISC
and I-MISC
a I-MISC
half I-MISC
of O
argument O
, O
the O
justices O
were O
aggressive O
in O
peppering O
lawyers O
with O
questions O
, O
and O
they O
seemed O
interested O
on O
two B-MISC
issues O
. O

Was O
there O
a O
federal O
issue O
involved O
that O
would O
even O
require O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
to O
rule O
? O
and O
if O
so O
, O
did O
the B-ORG
Florida I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
improperly O
rewrite O
Florida B-LOC
law O
, O
as O
Governor O
Bush B-PER
contends O
? O

A O
sure O
sign O
of O
the O
historic O
nature O
of O
the O
day B-MISC

proceeding O
, O
for O
the O
first B-MISC
time O
ever O
, O
the O

immediately O
released O

But O
in O

, O
listening O

was O

Even O
now O
, O

after O
that O

ended O
, O
there O
are O
still O

circling O
the B-MISC

As O

up O

Ted B-PER

lawyer O
for O
George B-PER
W. I-PER
Bush I-PER
, O
laying O
out O
the O
campaign O

main O
claim O
. O

Olson B-PER
made O
it O
through O
only B-MISC
56 I-MISC
seconds I-MISC
of O
his O
arguments O
before O
a O
justice O
broke O
in O
. O

Well O
, O
Mr. O
Olson B-PER
-- O

Sandra B-PER
Day I-PER
O'Connor I-PER
, O
often O
the O
swing O
vote O
on O
this O
court O
, O
demanded O
to O
know O
why O
the O
court O
even O
had O
a O
role O
in O
this O
case O
. O

Olson B-PER
argued O
that O
a O
century B-MISC
- I-MISC
old I-MISC
federal O
statute O
prevents O
laws O
governing O
an O
election O
from O
being O
created O
after O
the O
fact O
which O
, O
he O
claimed O
, O
is O
just O
what O
the O
Florida B-LOC
court O
did O
, O
and O
also O
, O
that O
the B-MISC
U.S. I-MISC
Constitution I-MISC
gives O
state O
legislatures O
, O
not O
the O
courts O
, O
the O
right O
to O
choose O
electors O
. O

Of O
all O
the O
justices O
it O
was O
Ruth B-PER
Bader I-PER
Ginsburg I-PER
who O
seemed O
most O
sympathetic O
to O
the B-ORG
Florida I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
. O

Midway O
through O
the O
hearing O
, O
Chief O
Justice O
Rehnquist B-PER
seemed O
to O
scold O
his O
colleagues O
for O
being O
too O
talkative O
when O
he O
made O
an O
unusual O
offer O
to O
the O
lawyer O
representing O
Florida B-LOC
's O
Attorney O
General O
. O

And O
so O
it O
went O
on O
. O

Laurence B-PER
Tribe I-PER
, O
Gore B-PER
's O
attorney O
, O
said O
the O
state O
court O
did O
nothing O
illegal O
. O

It O
simply O
provided O
a O
way O
for O
a O
close O
election O
to O
be O
examined O
. O

Justice O
O'Connor B-PER
again O
, O
but O
this O
time O
suggesting O
the O
state O
court O
had O
overstepped O
its O
authority O
and O
perhaps O
there O
was O
a O
federal O
case O
here O
. O

Justice O
Antonin B-PER
Scalia I-PER
also O
pressed O
Tribe B-PER
. O

He O
said O
the O
state O
court O
relied O
on O
the B-MISC
Florida I-MISC
Constitution I-MISC
to O
draft O
its O
decision O
, O
excluding O
state O
lawmakers O
and O
that O
violated O
the B-MISC
U.S. I-MISC
Constitution I-MISC
. O

It O
was O
Justice O
Breyer B-PER
who O
asked O
the O
most O
straightforward O
question O
of O
all O
. O

What O
happens O
if O
the O
court O
rules O
in O
favor O
of O
Bush B-PER
? O

The O
answer O
from O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
's O
lawyer O
was O
, O
Bush B-PER
wins O
and O
all O
the O
litigation O
in O
Florida B-LOC
ends O
. O

Not O
everyone O
agrees O
. O

They O
say O
that O
no O
matter O
which O
way O
the O
court O
rules O
, O
it O
will O
not O
provide O
nearly O
so O
much O
finality O
to O
this O
presidential O
election O

reaction O
to O
the O
work O
that O
will O
cause O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
we O
're O
certainly O
prepared O
to O
brief O
all O
the O
issues O
. O

I O
think O
that O
the O
circuit O
court O
judge O
, O
Judge O
Sauls B-PER
gave O
a O
very O
well O
reasoned O
and O
thorough O
, O
both O
legal O
and O
factual O
discussion O
of O
Florida B-LOC
law O
. O

Well O
, O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
your O
statement O
earlier B-MISC
today I-MISC
that O
the O
Vice O
President O
-- O
I O
guess O
you O
were O
asked O
should O
the O
Vice O
President O
concede O
, O
and O
you O
answered O
, O
the O
Vice O
President O
should O
do O
what O
's O
best O
for O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

Is O
that O
what O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
say O
? O

Well O
, O
sure O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
think O
that O
all O
the O
people O
involved O
in O
this O
unique O
situation O
, O
the O
first B-MISC
time O
a O
presidential O
election O
in O
our O
history O
has O
been O
contested O
, O
Brian B-PER
, O
need O
to O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
, O
as O
they O
see O
fit O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
the O
judge O
there O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
just O
giving O
out O
his O
ruling O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
court O
session O
today B-MISC
, O
he O
went O
on O
beyond O
the O
basic O
issues O
and O
added O
reason O
upon O
reason O
for O
why O
he O
turned O
down O
the O
Gore B-PER
case O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
his O
method O
there O
was O
to O
try O
to O
make O
this O
more O
or O
less O
appeal O
proof O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
what O
he O
did O
was O
addressed O
the O
situation O
as O
it O
exists O
in O
Florida B-LOC
and O
addressed O
the O
contingencies O
that O
were O
raised O
in O
the O
voluminous O
briefs O
that O
he O
had O
, O
not O
only O
from O
the O
two B-MISC
party O
candidates O
involved O
, O
but O
also O
of O
the O
interveners O
who O
were O
in O
the O
case O
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
the O
Democratic B-MISC
line O
throughout O
is O
they O
wo O
n't O
be O
happy O
until O
every O
vote O
is O
counted O
, O
and O
we O
could O
n't O
help O
but O
notice O
, O
should O
we O
call O
it O
a O
rhetorical O
device O
you O
used O
when O
talking O
to O
reporters O
this B-MISC
afternoon I-MISC
. O

Pause O
and O
listen O
along O
with O
us O
to O
the O
following O
piece O
of O
videotape O
. O

Those O
ballots O
have O
been O
counted O
not O
once O
on O
election B-MISC
night I-MISC
but O
twice O
in O
the O
recount O
and O
how O
many O
did O
you O
say O
there O
were O
? O

10,750 B-MISC
-- O

If O
you O
know O
the O
exact O
number O
, O
does O
n't O
that O
mean O
they O
've O
been O
counted O
? O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
suppose O
that O
was O
any O
accident O
on O
your O
part O
? O

Well O
, O
they O
have O
been O
making O
this O
point O
throughout O
these O
proceedings O
that O
these O
ballots O
have O
never O
been O
counted O
, O
and O
that O
is O
factually O
not O
true O
. O

They O
have O
been O
counted O
on O
election B-MISC
night I-MISC
-- O
they O
've O
been O
counted O
in O
the O
recounts O
, O
and O
it O
simply O
happens O
to O
be O
not O
the O
case O
that O
those O
ballots O
have O
failed O
to O
be O
counted O
by O
anyone O
. O

Ben B-PER
, O
for O
better O
or O
worse O
, O
you O
are O
forced O
now O
to O
follow O
the O
Gore B-PER
team O
as O
they O
take O
you O
on O
a O
kind O
of O
trail O
of O
appeal O
here O
. O

If O
you O
were O
asked O
to O
predict O
whether O
this O
stops O
at O
the O
Florida B-LOC
or O
U.S. B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
, O
what O
would O
your O
prediction O
be O
? O

I O
think O
it O
's O
one O
of O
those O
situations O
where O
I O
would O
have O
predicted O
all O
, O
Brian B-PER
. O

I O
think O
that O
the O
decisions O
are O
not O
ours O
to O
make O
. O

We O
'll O
be O
involved O
in O
all O
the O
legal O
processes O
obviously O
as O
long O
as O
the O
Gore B-PER
campaign O
keeps O
them O
up O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
long O
that O
takes O
. O

Ben O
Ginsberg O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O

after O

long O

The O
talks O
which O
the O
Secretary O
General O
of O
the B-ORG
Arab I-ORG
League I-ORG
Amr B-PER
Moussa I-PER
is O
holding O
in O
Lebanon B-LOC
for O
the O
second B-MISC
consecutive O
day O
, O
to O
find O
a O
way O
out O
of O
the O
current O
political O
crisis O
, O
have O
made O
progress O
according O
to O
what O
Moussa B-PER
himself O
announced O
this B-MISC
afternoon I-MISC
from O
the O
offices O
of O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
after O
he O
met O
Prime O
Minister O
Fuad B-PER
Siniora I-PER
, O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
Sudanese B-MISC
President O
's O
envoy O
Mustafa B-PER
Osman I-PER
Ismail I-PER
. O

We O
are O
now O
in O
the O
course O
of O
communicating O
, O
consulting O
, O
tracking O
and O
-- O
agreeing O
on O
many O
issues O
relating O
to O
the O
situation O
here O
. O

By O
God O
we O
have O
reached O
, O
ah O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
to O
a O
mood O
, O
ah O
, O
much O
better O
in O
-- O
and O
we O
are O
talking O
with O
different O
parties O
. O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
achieve O
progress O
unless O
we O
reach O
with O
all O
parties O
, O
to O
, O
ah O
, O
a O
basis O
which O
all O
agree O
on O
, O
which O
has O
benefit O
and O
might O
have O
concession O
. O

The O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
basis O
and O
objective O
is O
the O
most O
famous O
Lebanese B-MISC
principle O
: O
no O
winner O
, O
no O
loser O
. O

Moussa B-PER
and O
Ismail B-PER
's O
round O
of O
talks O
included O
since O
this O
morning O
the O
Maronite B-MISC
leader O
Patriarch B-PER
Sfeir I-PER
, O
who O
supported O
the O
Arab B-MISC
initiative O
. O

It O
also O
included O
MP O
Michel B-PER
Aoun I-PER
who O
is O
one O
of O
the O
pillars O
of O
the O
opposition O
. O

Moussa B-PER
said O
that O
the O
latter O
showed O
great O
understanding O
towards O
ending O
the O
climate O
of O
tension O
and O
reaching O
an O
agreement O
on O
all O
different O
frameworks O
which O
protect O
Lebanon B-LOC
. O

There O
are O
issues O
that O
require O
now O
, O
ah O
-considering O
they O
are O
the O
main O
issues O
-- O
that O
we O
solve O
them O
, O
and O
there O
are O
other O
issues O
whose O
time O
and O
context O
will O
come O
, O
ah O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
context O
. O

Moussa B-PER
and O
his O
accompanying O
delegation O
also O
had O
consultations O
with O
former O
Lebanese B-MISC
President O
Amin B-PER
Gemayel I-PER
, O
who O
pointed O
out O
the O
economic O
, O
social O
and O
lifestyle O
results O
from O
all O
that O
is O
happening O
today B-MISC
, O
which O
are O
negative O
as O
a O
whole O
, O
if O
the O
situation O
is O
not O
rectified O
and O
work O
is O
not O
done O
to O
find O
appropriate O
solutions O
. O

Moussa B-PER
met O
also O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Democratic O
Gathering O
, O
MP O
Walid B-PER
Jumblatt I-PER
, O
the O
prominent O
personality O
in O
the O
parliamentary O
and O
government O
majority O
. O

Moussa B-PER
announced O
that O
his O
consultations O
will O
be O
repeated O
as O
well O
with O
the O
head O
of O
the O
government O
and O
the O
speaker O
of O
parliament O
before O
meeting O
President O
of O

The B-ORG
Somali I-ORG
Islamic I-ORG
Courts I-ORG
announced O
that O
Ethiopia B-LOC
had O
invaded O
the O
country O
and O
called O
on O
all O
Somalis B-MISC
to O
expel O
them O
. O

The O
Courts O
also O
said O
that O
its O
fighters O
killed O
203 B-MISC
Ethiopians B-MISC
, O
and O
wounded O
twice O
this O
number O
, O
. O

Lines O
are O
intertwined O
in O
Somalia B-LOC
with O
the O
escalation O
of O
events O
that O
raise O
many O
questions O
. O

Has O
that O
country O
reached O
the O
brink O
of O
an O
all O
- O
out O
war O
that O
may O
drag O
into O
it O
, O
in O
one O
way O
or O
another O
, O
most O
of O
the O
Horn B-LOC
of I-LOC
Africa I-LOC
states O
? O

And O
, O
is O
it O
possible O
to O
resume O
the O
Khartoum B-LOC
negotiations O
in O
light O
of O
the O
continued O
present O
complication O
of O
issues O
? O

The O
answer O
so O
far O
appears O
unclear O
. O

The O
fighters O
of O
the O
Islamic B-MISC
Courts O
announced O
their O
control O
of O
the O
city O
of O
Ibla B-LOC
south O
of O
Baidoa B-LOC
, O
the O
headquarters O
of O
the O
transitional O
government O
, O
after O
killing O
dozens O
of O
Ethiopian B-MISC
soldiers O
in O
that O
city O
. O

They O
warned O
about O
the O
likelihood O
of O
opening O
new O
fighting O
fronts O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Jaree B-LOC
, O
where O
they O
say O
Ethiopian B-MISC
troops O
have O
entered O
. O

<foreign O
lang="unknown"> O
</foreign> O

We O
want O
the O
entire O
world O
to O
know O
that O
Ethiopia B-LOC
has O
invaded O
Somalia B-LOC
and O
the O
war O
now O
is O
with O
the O
Ethiopian B-MISC
government O
. O

All O
the O
people O
of O
Somalia B-LOC
are O
urged O
to O
repel O
this O
invasion O
. O

So O
far O
we O
have O
defeated O
the O
enemies O
, O
but O
I O
call O
on O
all O
the O
people O
to O
rise O
up O
to O
expel O
the O
enemy O
out O
of O
the O
country O
. O

The O
Somali B-MISC
transitional O
government O
has O
acknowledged O
the O
violent O
fighting O
taking O
place O
in O
the O
south O
of O
the O
country O
, O

but O
it O
has O
described O
it O
as O
occurring O
between O
the O
forces O
of O
the O
government O
and O
the O
fighters O
of O
the O
Islamic B-MISC
Courts O
that O
reject O
the O
country O
's O
legitimate O
authority O
. O

It O
has O
denied O
any O
connection O
with O
the O
Ethiopians B-MISC
or O
others O
in O
the O
matter O
. O

Parliament O
has O
approved O
dispatching O
forces O
to O
help O
us O
train O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
national O
forces O
. O

So O
the O
Ethiopian B-MISC
forces O
are O
from O
these O
, O
are O
among O
these O
forces O
. O

And O
in O
such O
deteriorating O
conditions O
in O
which O
all O
sides O
exchange O
blame O
, O
dense O
fog O
seems O
to O
surround O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
mission O
undertaken O
over O
the O
last O
few O
days O
by O
Louis B-PER
Michel I-PER
, O
the O
European B-ORG
Union I-ORG
Aid I-ORG
Commissioner O
. O

Michel B-PER
had O
announced O
that O
the O
parties O
to O
the O
conflict O
have O
agreed O
to O
stop O
fighting O
, O
but O
this O
has O
not O
yet O
happened O
. O

He O
also O
announced O
the O
agreement O
by O
the O
concerned O
parties O
to O
resume O
the O
Khartoum B-LOC
negotiations O
. O

And O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
only O
remaining O
glimmer O
of O
hope O
to O
extinguish O
the O
fuse O
is O
for O
the O
parties O
to O
go O
to O
Khartoum B-LOC
without O
conditions O
, O
despite O
the O
difficulties O
entailed O
with O
accomplishing O
this O
. O




Lebanon B-LOC
, O
Iraq B-LOC
and O
other O
hot O
issues O
were O
for O
the O
most O
part O
the O
gist O
of O
the O
call O
with O
which O
the O
Gulf O
leaders O
concluded O
their O
27th B-MISC
summit O
in O
Riyadh B-LOC

Yes O
, O
Dalila B-PER
, O
the O
concluding O
statement O
of O
the O
Riyadh B-LOC
summit O
warned O
against O
the O
partition O
of O

demanded O
that O
parties O
it O
left O
unnamed O
not O
interfere O
in O
the O
internal O

Certainly O

the O

did O
not O
conclude O
this O

The O
session O
was O
in O
the O
Gulf O
, O
but O
the O
flavor O
that O
characterized O
the O
atmosphere O
of O
the B-MISC
Cooperation I-MISC
Council I-MISC
summit I-MISC
was O
a O
blend O
of O
the O
crisis O
issues O
of O
the O
region O

each O
according O
to O
its O
degree O
of O
urgency O

But O
Iraq B-LOC

with O
its O

, O
won O
a O
large O
share O
of O
the O
concluding O
statement O
of O
the B-MISC
Jaber I-MISC

The O
security O

reminded O

And O
on O
the O
rest O
of O
the O

in O

Lebanon B-LOC

the O

the O

Concerning O

The O

reviewed O

all O
the O
legal O
maneuvering O
he O
is O
calling O
on O
both O

to O
put O

politics O
aside O

I O
think O
that O
both O
Governor O

should O
recognize O
an O
obligation O
during O
this O
time O
when O

to O
try O

Meanwhile O
, O
Bush B-PER

was O
a O
busy O
man O
today B-MISC

After O
a O
heart O

he O
appeared O

say O
that O
he O

pressing O

We O
have O
now O
acquired O
office O
space O
in O
McClain B-LOC
, O
Virginia B-LOC
that O
will O
become O
the O
site O
for O
the O
transition O
operation O
that O
we O
announced O
two B-MISC
days I-MISC
ago I-MISC
, O
so O
we O
are O
just O
in O
a O
business O
of O
getting O
up O

running O
, O
but O
we O
now O
have O
an O
office O
with O
a O

We O
have O
got O
people O
signing O
up O
, O
volunteers O
coming O
on O

being O

so O
we O
will O
be O
fully O
operational O
within O
the B-MISC

two I-MISC
. O

Earlier B-MISC
today I-MISC
in O
Florida B-LOC

the O
Republican B-MISC

a O
special O
session O
to O
pick O
the O

itself O

should O
the O
December B-MISC
12th I-MISC

still O
find O
the O
election O
tied O
up O

The O
committee O
heard O
from O
angry O
voters O
and O
precinct O
workers O
in O
Palm B-LOC
Beach I-LOC
. O

I O
believe O
our O
issues O
do O
relate O
directly O
to O
the O
appointing O
of O
electors O
for O
the O
state O
of O
Florida B-LOC
. O

The O
electors O
need O
to O
be O
appointed O
, O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
appointed O
according O
to O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
and O
I O
believe O
in O
Palm B-LOC
Beach I-LOC
County I-LOC
that O
it O
was O
very O
difficult O
to O
determine O
what O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
was O
. O

Although O
Al B-PER
Gore I-PER
said O
today B-MISC
that O
he O
certainly O
feels O
like O
he O
won O
the O
election O
, O
he O
put O
his O
odds O
of O
wining O
the O
various O
legal O
battles O
at O
fifty B-MISC
- O
fifty B-MISC
. O

Gore B-PER
said O
, O
if O
Bush B-PER
does O
triumph O
in O
court O
, O
he O
will O
throw O
his O
support O
behind O
the O
Republican B-MISC
President O
- O
elect O
. O

But O
for O
now O
, O
says O
former O
Clinton B-PER
administration O
cabinet O
member O
Robert B-PER
Riche I-PER
, O
both O
sides O
are O
positive O
that O
they O
've O
won O
the O
election O
, O
and O
says O
Riche B-PER
, O
the O
longer O
the O
fight O
goes O
on O
, O
the O
more O
troublesome O
the B-MISC
next I-MISC
four I-MISC
years I-MISC
might O
be O
. O

What O
we O
risk O
by O
prolonging O
this O
is O
greater O
public O
cynicism O
and O
a O
hardening O
of O
partisan O
lines O
among O
career O
politicians O
who O
have O
to O
work O
together O
. O

After O
all O
, O
come O
January B-MISC
, O
these O
people O
are O
going O
to O
have O
to O
be O
in O
Washington B-LOC
whether O

I O

you O

the O

know O
his O

Tell O
us O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
him O
, O
Who O
is O
he O
and O
why O
did O
he O
flee O
China B-LOC

Gao B-PER
Xingjian I-PER
is O
quite O
an O
interesting O
writer O
because O
in O
some O
senses O
he O
differs O
from O
the O
great O
cohort O
of O
contemporary O
Chinese B-MISC
writers O
that O
are O
well O
known O
in O
the O
West B-MISC
today O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
great O
difference O
about O
Gao B-PER
Xingjian I-PER
is O
that O
he O
actually O
received O
a O
university O
education O
. O

He O
was O
educated O
in O
French B-MISC
, O
so O
has O
a O
very O
good O
knowledge O
of O
French B-MISC
literature O
and O
it O
is O
very O
much O
French B-MISC
literature O
that O
has O
influenced O
his O
own O
literary O
creativities O
, O
only O
free O
production O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
conservative O
Chinese B-MISC
critics O
would O
accuse O
him O
of O
blind O
worship O
of O
Western B-MISC
models O
. O

Sartre B-PER
is O
a O
big O
man O
in O
Mr. O
Xingjian B-PER
's O
life O
, O
is O
n't O
he O
? O

I O
would O
say O
so O
that O
Sartre B-PER
has O
been O
a O
quite O
a O
big O
influence O
. O

I O
think O
the O
other O
influences O
would O
be O
Samuel B-PER
Beckett I-PER
, O
the O
Irish B-MISC
and O
French B-MISC
language O
writer O
, O
Unesco B-PER
. O

These O
are O
models O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
all O
of O
these O
writers O
are O
writers O
who O
were O
active O
in O
the B-MISC
first I-MISC
half I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
twentieth I-MISC
century I-MISC
. O

Well O
, O
this O
is O
very O
interesting O
because O
Mr. O
Gao B-PER
left O
China B-LOC
before O
Tianenmen B-MISC
. O

He O
wrote O
a O
play O
, O
in O
particular O
about O
the O
events O
there O
. O

Would O
you O
say O
that O
his O
influences O
may O
be O
more O
French B-MISC
literary O
then O
they O
were O
his O
own O
immediate O
life O
experience O
? O

I O
would O
say O
both O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
because O
the O
first B-MISC
play O
that O
he O
wrote O
that O
made O
him O
famous O
was O
a O
play O
that O
dates O
from O
1981 B-MISC
, O
which O
was O
actually O
called O
` B-MISC
Bus I-MISC
Stop I-MISC
' I-MISC
, O
which O
many O
people O
said O
or O
had O
resonances O
from O
Beckett B-PER
's O
play O
` O
Waiting B-MISC
for I-MISC
Godot I-MISC
' O
and O
it O
concerned O
a O
number O
of O
Chinese B-MISC
people O
from O
different O
walks O
of O
life O
who O
were O
standing O
at O
a O

stop O
waiting O
for O
a O

So O
, O
we O
can O
see O
immediately O
that O
the O
resonances O
with O
the O
play O
of O
Beckett B-PER

but O
Gao B-PER
Xingjian I-PER
really O
before O
1989 B-MISC
felt O
, O
that O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
write O

to O
have O
his O

produced O
, O
as O
he O
would O
wish O

so O
left O
China B-LOC
couple B-MISC

years I-MISC
before O
the O
incident O
at O
Tiananmen B-MISC
in O
1989 B-MISC

I O
think O
it O
is O
a B-MISC
great I-MISC
day I-MISC
for O
modern O
Chinese B-MISC
literature O
and O
it O
is O
a B-MISC
day I-MISC

60 I-MISC

Well O
we O
ca O
n't O
tell O
you O
who O
won O
Florida B-LOC
, O
but O
in O
a O
moment O
we O
will O
enter O
the O
musical O
question O
, O
who O
let O
the O
dogs O
out O
? O

First B-MISC
up O
we O
have O
the O
answer O
to O
our O
geo O
quiz O
today B-MISC
. O

We O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
region O
of O
central O
Italy B-LOC
bordering O
the B-MISC
Adriatic I-MISC
Sea I-MISC
. O

The O
area O
is O
mostly O
mountainous O
and O
includes O
Mt. B-MISC
Corno I-MISC
, O
the O
highest O
peak O
of O
the O
Apennines B-MISC
. O

It O
also O
includes O
a O
lot O
of O
sheep O
, O
good O
clean O
- O
living O
, O
healthy O
sheep O
, O
and O
an O
Italian B-MISC
entrepreneur O
has O
an O
idea O
about O
how O
to O
make O
a O
little O
money O
of O
them O
. O

The O
answer O
is O
Abruzzo B-LOC
. O

Journalist O
Carlos B-PER
Depalazai I-PER
was O
in O
Rome B-LOC
, O
Italy B-LOC
and O
Carlo B-PER
how O
does O
this O
fellow O
plan O
to O
profit O
from O
the O
sheep O
of O
the O
Abruzzo B-LOC
? O

He O
is O
taking O
advantage O
of O
two B-MISC
crazes O
that O
we O
are O
having O
in O
the O
Italy B-LOC
at O
the O
moment O
, O
one B-MISC
is O
internet O
, O
the O
other O
one B-MISC
is O
the O
awareness O
on O
food O
. O

So O
this O
guy O
came O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
having O
people O
adopting O
sheep O
by O
an O
internet O
. O

So O
you O
can O
have O
access O
through O
your O
computer O
on O
your O
desk O
. O

Go O
to O
the O
web O
site O
of O
these O
guys O
and O
you O
can O
have O
look O
at O
the O
face O
of O
sheep O
which O
are O
available O
to O
be O
adopted O
. O

So O
what O
does O
it O
mean O
to O
adopt O
a O
sheep O
, O
to O
show O
up O
on O
your O
back O
step O
or O
do O
you O
, O
somehow O
keep O
track O
of O
its O
progress O
on O
the O
farm O
in O
Italy B-LOC
? O

You O
are O
not O
actually O
adopting O
the O
sheep O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
you O
can O
have O
it O
with O
you O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
distant O
adoption O
, O
where O
you O
do O
n't O
actually O
have O
the O
child O
in O
your O
home O
. O

You O
are O
just O
contributing O
with O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
money O
and O
you O
are O
monitoring O
the O
growing O
up O
. O

It O
works O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
so O
you O
have O
access O
on O
the O
web O
site O
of O
this O
little O
farm O
, O
in O
a O
little O
village O
of O
Abrutzi B-LOC
and O
you O
can O
choose O
among O
many O
, O
many O
sheeps O
and O
after O
contributing O
with O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
money O
the O
sheep O
is O
actually O
yours O
. O

All O
right O
, O
so O
the O
amount O
of O
money O
you O
have O
mentioned O
to O
us O
is O
about B-MISC
160 I-MISC
US I-MISC
dollars I-MISC
and O
for O
that O
you O
get O
more O
than O
just O
a O
warm O
and O
fuzzy O
feeling O
. O

You O
can O
also O
receive O
leggings O
that O
are O
made O
from O
wool O
of O
the O
sheep O
and O
even O
if O
you O
like O
some O
of O
the O
sheep O
dropping O
delivered O
to O
your O
door O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
mean O
this O
is O
quite O
funny O
, O
but O
apart O
from O
all O
the O
details O
, O
which O
are O
sometimes O
even O
strange O
I O
think O
what O
is O
really O
important O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
sign O
of O
a O
new O
concern O
that O
is O
effecting O
Italian B-MISC
people O
. O

I O
mean O
we O
are O
notoriously O
lover O
of O
good O
food O
. O

We O
have O
a O
generous O
attitude O
towards O
food O
, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
new O
stuff O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
you O
really O
care O
about O
a O
sheep O
in O
the O
way O
she O
is O
fed O
, O
in O
the O
way O
she O
is O
nurtured O
, O
in O
the O
way O
people O
are O
looking O
after O
it O
, O
because O
it O
's O
a O
way O
to O
ensure O
that O
you O
have O
something O
which O
is O
genuine O
on O
your O
table O
up O
the O
end O
. O

Wait O
a B-MISC
minute I-MISC
, O
you O
said O
that O
on O
your O
table O
at O
the O
end O
. O

Yeah O
, O
at O
the O
table O
if O
it O
becomes O
food O
for O
instance O
, O
which O
is O
an O
option O
. O

You O
are O
adopting O
the O
sheep O
and O
whatever O
happens O
at O
the O
end O
it O
's O
your O
choice O
and O
among O
the O
option O
is O
you O
know O
food O
for O
your O
meal O
. O

That O
kind O
of O
puts O
a O
whole O
new O
tone O
to O
this O
thing O
. O

I O
mean O
usually O
when O
you O
think O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
adoption O
that O
means O
saving O
an O
animal O
not O
eventually O
eating O
it O
. O

I O
mean O
this O
is O
an O
option O
which O
is O
available O
and O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
provocation O
. O

You O
know O
Italians B-MISC
now O
mainly O
live O
in O
metropolitan O
areas O
in O
big O
cities O
like O
Rome B-LOC
, O
Florence B-LOC
, O
Naples B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
we O
were O
a O
population O
of O
shepherds O
or O
farmers O
. O

We O
had O
completely O
different O
attitude O
towards O
nature O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
we O
are O
losing O
something O
, O
and O
we O
need O
to O
reestablish O
a O
better O
relationship O
with O
nature O
and O
the O
simple O
fact O
that O
the O
Environment O
Minister O
in O
Italy B-LOC
supported O
the O
initiative O
and O
he O
himself O
adopted O
a O
sheep O
is O
significant O
. O

He O
took O
advantage O
immediately O
of O
these O
ideas O
to O
build O
up O
a O
new O
awareness O
and O
a O
new O
attitude O
of O
Italians B-MISC
towards O
nature O
and O
farms O
. O

the O
rising O
prices O
of O

such O

it O

This O
year O

down O

the O

When O
the B-MISC

paying O

such O

even O

What O
we O

right O
now O
is O
a O
political O

until O

resolved O

there O

With O
eighteen B-MISC

go O

Zimbabwe B-LOC

If O

the O

continue O

contract O

This B-MISC

it O

Next B-MISC

we O
see O
a O

So O
we O

his O
first B-MISC

The O
World B-ORG
's O
Jeb B-PER
Sharp I-PER
reports O
on O
the O
still O
unresolved O
fate O
of O
Slobodan B-PER
Milosevic I-PER
. O

He O
's O
kept O
Western B-MISC
diplomats O
spinning O
in O
circles O
for O
more B-MISC
than I-MISC
a I-MISC
decade I-MISC
. O

Five B-MISC
years I-MISC
ago I-MISC
they O
were O
negotiating O
with O
Milosevic B-PER
at O
Dayton B-LOC
to O
stop O
the O
war O
in O
Bosnia B-LOC
. O

Two B-MISC
years I-MISC
ago I-MISC
they O
were O
still O
shuttling O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
Belgrade B-LOC
in O
an O
effort O
to O
solve O
the O
Kosovo B-LOC
crisis O
. O

By O
March B-MISC
of I-MISC
last I-MISC
year I-MISC
they O
had O
given O
up O
talking O
and O
Nato B-ORG
had O
started O
bombing O
instead O
. O

When O
Milosevic B-PER
was O
indited O
on O
war O
crimes O
charges O
soon O
after O
, O
US B-LOC
and O
other O
Western B-MISC
officials O
began O
calling O
for O
his O
arrest O
and O
transfer O
to O
The B-LOC
Hague I-LOC
, O
but O
now O
that O
a O
delicate O
transition O
is O
underway O
in O
Serbia B-LOC
, O
those O
calls O
have O
grown O
quieter O
, O
according O
to O
Gary B-PER
Bass I-PER
, O
the O
author O
of O
the O
new O
book O
about O
war O
crimes O
trials O
, O
` O
Stay B-MISC
, I-MISC
the I-MISC

' O
. O

Even O
Madeleine B-PER
Albright I-PER
, O
who O
is O
with O
the O
President O
who O
is O
usually O
most O
decipherous O
about O
the O
importance O
of O
prosecuting O
war O
criminals O
, O
has O
in O
fact O
said O
that O
our O
first B-MISC
priority O
is O
making O
sure O
that O
Vojislov B-PER
Kostunica I-PER
can O
consolidate O
his O
democratic O
government O
and O
make O
that O
transition O
, O
and O
the O
issue O
of O
punishing O
war O
criminals O
sort O
of O
takes O
a O
back O
seat O
. O

Bass B-PER
says O
US B-LOC
diplomats O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
risk O
destabilizing O
Serbia B-LOC
's O
fragile O
political O
situation O
by O
pushing O
too O
hard O
for O
war O
crimes O
trials O
. O

After O
all O
Bass B-PER
points O
out O
, O
outside O
pressure O
has O
backfired O
in O
the O
past O
. O

In O
Germany B-LOC
after O
World B-MISC
War I-MISC
I I-MISC
and O
in O
the B-ORG
Ottoman I-ORG
Empire I-ORG
also O
after O
World B-MISC
War I-MISC
I I-MISC
, O
the O
British B-MISC
and O
the O
French B-MISC
pushed O
really O
hard O
for O
war O
crimes O
trials O
, O
and O
the O
result O
in O
both O
countries O
was O
a O
kind O
of O
a O
nationalist O
backlash O
. O

A O
nationalist O
backlash O
in O
Serbia B-LOC
right O
now O
could O
play O
into O
Milosevic B-PER
's O
hands O
, O
especially O
with O
parliamentary O
elections O
scheduled O
for O
next B-MISC
month I-MISC
. O

That O
's O
one B-MISC
reason O
Western B-MISC
governments O
are O
not O
demanding O
his O
immediate O
arrest O
, O
but O
critics O
of O
this O
approach O
say O
letting O
Milosevic B-PER
stay O
in O
Belgrade B-LOC
could O
be O
equally O
destabilizing O
. O

Eva B-PER
Barnetts I-PER
, O
professor O
of O
history O
at O
Yale B-ORG
, O
says O
President O
Kostunica B-PER
should O
cooperate O
immediately O
with O
the B-ORG
Hague I-ORG
Tribunal I-ORG
. O

This O
particular O
UN B-ORG
institution O
has O
in O
its O
power O
really O
to O
give O
instant O
legitimacy O
to O
Kostunica B-PER
but O
of O
course O
at O
a O
price O
. O

It O
means O
that O
the O
government O
of O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
has O
to O
become O
very O
serious O
about O
dealing O
with O
the O
indited O
war O
criminals O
, O
beginning O
with O
Slobodan B-PER
Milosevic I-PER
himself O
. O

But O
even O
officials O
at O
The B-LOC
Hague I-LOC
say O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
be O
patient O
with O
the O
new O
Yugoslav B-MISC
President O
. O

Tribunal B-ORG
spokesman O
Jim B-PER
Landel I-PER
says O
it O
helps O
that O
Kostunica B-PER
's O
people O
who O
initially O
refused O
to O
even O
entertain O
the O
idea O
of O
arresting O
Milosevic B-PER
, O
may O
be O
starting O
to O
cooperate O
with O
the O
Tribunal B-ORG
. O

They O
have O
already O
indicated O
that O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
allow O
the O
reopening O
of O
the O
prosecutor O
's O
liaison O
office O
in O
Belgrade B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
's O
certainly O
a O
welcome O
first B-MISC
step O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
only O
a O
first B-MISC
step O
. O

The O
Tribunal B-ORG
's O
chief O
prosecutor O
Carla B-PER
Del I-PER
Ponte I-PER
has O
applied O
for O
a O
Yugoslav B-MISC
visa O
and O
plans O
to O
visit O
Belgrade B-LOC
soon O
. O

Delponte B-PER
's O
spokeswoman O
says O
the O
prosecutor O
has O
much O
to O
discuss O
with O
Kostunica B-PER
, O
not O
least O
how O
to O
arrest O
all O
the O
indited O
war O
crimes O
suspects O
now O
in O
Serbia B-LOC
. O

That O
wo O
n't O
be O
easy O
. O

Even O
in O
Bosnia B-LOC
where O
Nato B-ORG
is O
in O
charge O
, O
troops O
have O
failed O
to O
capture O
Bosnian B-MISC
- I-MISC
Serb I-MISC
leader O
Radavan B-PER
Karadzic I-PER
, O
indited O
on O
genocide O
charges O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
1995 B-MISC
massacre O
at O
Shrabanitca B-LOC
. O

Yale B-ORG
history O
professor O
Eva B-PER
Barnett I-PER
says O
the O
excuses O
for O
not O
arresting O
Karadzic B-PER
are O
not O
persuasive O
. O

The O
claim O
is O
that O
this O
would O
engender O
tremendously O
destabilizing O
consequences O
that O
in O
any O
event O
it O
might O
be O
a O
very O
, O
very O
bloody O
affair O
and O
so O
on O
. O

This O
does O
not O
seem O
terribly O
compelling O
to O
me O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
has O
to O
be O
tried O
and O
of O
course O
there O
is O
always O
a O
danger O
that O
somebody O
might O
get O
hurt O
in O
this O
, O
but O
that O
is O
a O
danger O
that O
every O
attempt O
at O
remedying O
criminal O
activity O
has O
to O
face O
. O

Hague B-ORG
prosecutor O
Carla B-PER
Del I-PER
Ponte I-PER
is O
prepared O
to O
discuss O
arrest O
strategies O
with O
Kostunica B-PER
including O
the O
use O
of O
foreign O
troops O
. O

It O
's O
difficult O
to O
know O
how O
he O
would O
react O
. O

Kostunica B-PER
has O
questioned O
the O
legality O
of O
the B-ORG
Hague I-ORG
Tribunal I-ORG
, O
and O
talked O
of O
trying O
Milosevic B-PER
in O

The O

The O

that O

Let O
's O
talk O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
about O
what O
the O
Navy B-ORG
does O
to O
prevent O
such O
tragedies O
. O

We O
were O
talking O
about O
it O
this B-MISC
morning I-MISC
and O
we O
put O
together O
some O
graphics O
for O
you O
. O

I O
'll O
try O
to O
explain O
it O
the O
best O
I O
can O
from O
what O
I O
remember O
from O
being O
on O
the B-MISC
`` I-MISC
USS I-MISC
Abraham I-MISC
Lincoln I-MISC
'' I-MISC
. O

This O
is O
an O
amphibious O
ship O
, O
rather O
, O
but O
this O
is O
what O
the O
Navy B-ORG
does O
with O
regard O
to O
prevention O
. O

, O
every O
sailor O
that O
's O
entering O
the O
Navy B-ORG
does O
take O
a O
swim O
test O
. O

They O
learn O
how O
to O
tread O
water O
and O
do O
the O
dead O
man O
float O
and O
they O
have O
to O
pass O
that O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
on O
. O

Also O
drills O
take O
place O
before O
sailors O
get O
on O
to O
any O
ship O
, O
before O
any O
deployment O
. O

Usually O
twice O
a O
day O
, O
they O
're O
practicing O
man O
overboard O
drills O
, O
knowing O
where O
to O
go O
, O
where O
to O
report O
to O
if O
indeed O
a O
man O
overboard O
takes O
place O
and O
as O
the O
deployment O
begins O
, O
those O
wane O
off O
, O
but O
they O
know O
where O
to O
go O
quickly O
. O

They O
also O
wear O
float O
coats O
. O

You O
can O
see O
them O
here O
. O

The O
yellow O
shirt O
is O
wearing O
a O
yellow O
float O
coat O
. O

Everything O
is O
color O
coordinated O
. O

You O
see O
the O
gentleman O
here O
wearing O
a O
brown O
one O
and O
they O
have O
toggles O
to O
pull O
and O
inflate O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
manual O
device O
so O
if O
the O
toggles O
do O
n't O
work O
they O
can O
blow O
air O
into O
the O
inflation O
device O
. O

They O
have O
dive O
goggles O
and O
they O
're O
able O
to O
find O
them O
. O

It O
also O
has O
a O
strobe O
light O
and O
a O
whistle O
. O

Also O
such O
location O
devices O
, O
some O
ships O
have O
smoke O
floats O
they O
can O
toss O
out O
so O
the O
man O
overboard O
will O
be O
able O
to O
use O
smoke O
signals O
as O
a O
way O
of O
trying O
to O
, O
let O
the O
rescuer O
locate O
them O
. O

Also O
24 B-MISC
/ O
7 O
there O
are O
individuals O
on O
watch O
, O
all O
throughout O
the O
ship O
, O
all O
around O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
indeed O
, O
there O
is O
netting O
on O
most O
parts O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
not O
all O
around O
the O
entire O
ship O
, O
but O
on O
most O
parts O
there O
is O
a O
very O
thick O
netting O
. O

Now O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
the O
man O
overboard O
rescue O
and O
when O
indeed O
there O
is O
a O
man O
overboard O
situation O
. O

You O
will O
hear O
a O
P.A. O
announcement O
around O
the O
entire O
ship O
, O
there O
is O
a O
man O
overboard O
so O
everyone O
knows O
they O
have O
to O
react O
quickly O
. O

A O
ship O
- O
wide O
search O
will O
happen O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
person O
go O
overboard O
, O
but O
if O
indeed O
they O
do O
see O
someone O
go O
overboard O
, O
the O
ship O
starts O
to O
circle O
that O
area O
continuously O
. O

Also O
small O
boats O
sometimes O
go O
out O
into O
the O
water O
, O
but O
even O
more O
importantly O
, O
helicopters O
are O
launched O
immediately O
. O

Inside O
those O
helicopters O
rescue O
swimmers O
. O

If O
indeed O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
located O
, O
well O
the O
hoister O
is O
dropped O
down O
with O
usually O
a O
torso O
harness O
. O

If O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
injured O
then O
they O
may O
use O
a O
basket O
, O
but O
more O
than O
likely O
those O
swimmers O
will O
go O
right O
into O
the O
water O
and O
try O
and O
help O
the O
swimmer O
hook O
up O
on O
that O
harness O
and O
pull O
them O
up O
into O
the O
helo O
and O
pull O
them O
back O
on O
to O
the O
ship O
for O
treatment O
and O
usually O
a O
search O
takes O
about B-MISC
24 I-MISC
hours I-MISC
. O

The O
search O
crews O
will O
go O
24 B-MISC
hours I-MISC
before O
calling O
off O
that O
search O
. O

Why O
call O
it O
off O
? O

There O
's O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
to O
look O
at O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
water O
temperature O
, O
it O
's O
very O
common O
in O
cold O
water O
that O
someone O
will O
not O
survive O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

Also O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
24 B-MISC
- I-MISC
hour I-MISC
search O
is O
they O
fail O
they O
've O
exhausted O
all O
resources O
by O
that O
time O
. O

Anyway O
, O
we O
'll O
continue O
to O
follow O
what O
's O
happening O
on O
the B-MISC
`` I-MISC

those O

Originally O
the B-ORG

said O
the O

was O
being O
expelled O
because O
he O
compromised O
the O
location O
of O
the O

Now O
a O
spokesman O
from O
the B-ORG

is O
saying O
and O
I O

quoting O
`` O
Frankly O

Says O
he O
's O
not O
aware O
he O
's O
being O
expelled O
but O
says O
if O
so O
, O
it O
is O
because O
some O
bitter O
former O
colleagues O
of O
his O
at O

blew O
the O

him O

It O
sounds O

some O

they O

you O
the O

yesterday B-MISC

He O
said O
the O

had O
failed O

Today B-MISC

`` O

said O
he O
was O
sorry O

I O
want O
to O
apologize O
to O
the O
American B-MISC
people O
for O
clearly O
making O
a O
misjudgment O
over O
the B-MISC
weekend I-MISC
by O
giving O
an O
interview O
to O
Iraqi B-MISC

Now O
, O
I O
said O
in O
that O

essentially O
what O
we O
all O
know O
about O

there O
have O
been O
delays O

has O
been O

clearly O
by O
giving O
that O
interview O
to O
Iraqi B-MISC

, O
I O
created O
a O
firestorm O
in O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC

and O
for O
that O
I O
am O
truly O
sorry O

hired O
Peter B-PER

the O

remains O

Peter B-PER

cross O
the O
line O

were O

quickly O

that O
those O

they O
're O
out O

and O
we O
need O
to O

Jonathan B-PER
Mann I-PER
takes O
a O
look O
at O
the O
man O
and O
his O
politics O
. O

Unlike O
President O
Milosevic B-PER
, O
he O
was O
not O
a O
Communist B-MISC
in O
the B-MISC
long I-MISC
years I-MISC
when O
party O
membership O
was O
the O
key O
to O
power O
. O

He O
was O
not O
among O
the O
prominent O
opposition O
figures O
who O
have O
struggled O
against O
each O
other O
almost O
as O
hard O
as O
the O
regime O
. O

He O
is O
an O
orthodox O
Serb B-MISC
nationalist O
, O
but O
he O
supports O
truer O
democracy O
for O
his O
country O
and O
better O
relations O
with O
its O
neighbors O
and O
the O
West B-MISC
. O

Kostunica B-PER
is O
a O
soft O
- O
spoken O
and O
uncharismatic O
figure O
who O
spent O
years O
building O
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Party I-ORG
of I-ORG
Serbia I-ORG
and O
gathering O
only O
modest O
support O
. O

After O
ten B-MISC
years I-MISC
, O
people O
know O
what O
are O
the O
differences O
between O
Milosevic B-PER
's O
policies O
and O
ours O
, O
what O
Milosevic B-PER
was O
saying O
and O
promising O
and O
what O
the O
opposition O
parties O
and O
I O
myself O
was O
saying O
in O
these B-MISC
years I-MISC
and O
how O
I O
was O
behaving O
. O

Kostunica B-PER
is O
56 B-MISC
, O
an O
expert O
on O
constitutional O
law O
who O
lives O
with O
his O
wife O
and O
pets O
in O
a O
Belgrade B-LOC
apartment O
. O

He O
was O
fired O
from O
his O
job O
teaching O
law O
in O
1974 B-MISC
for O
his O
opposition O
to O
the O
policies O
of O
the O
Tito B-PER
government O
. O

He O
refused O
an O
offer O
to O
return O
in O
1989 B-MISC
because O
of O
his O
opposition O
to O
the O
Milosevic B-PER
regime O
, O
and O
he O
rejects O
much O
from O
the O
West B-MISC
as O
well O
-- O
the O
Dayton B-LOC
peace O
accord O
, O
Western B-MISC
sanctions O
on O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
war O
crimes O
tribunal O
. O

In O
the B-MISC
months I-MISC
before O
the O
election O
, O
he O
was O
careful O
to O
distinguish O
between O
his O
support O
for O
European B-MISC
aid O
projects O
tied O
to O
reform O
and O
U.S. O
efforts O
, O
which O
he O
describes O
as O
unhelpful O
, O
even O
to O
the O
opposition O
. O

I O
know O
what O
the O
support O
means O
when O
we O
get O
from O
European B-ORG
Union I-ORG
, O
the O
programs O
like O

for O

, O

. O

Those O
small O

. O

Here O
we O
get O
nothing O
in O
advance O
, O
just O
a O
political O
support O
which O
consists O
of O
nothing O
, O
and O
which O
is O
mostly O
used O
and O
abused O
and O
manipulated O
by O
the O
regime O
, O
saying O
they O
are O
just O
NATO B-ORG
parties O
, O
as O
is O
often O
said O
by O
regime O
, O
they O
are O
not O
having O

forcible O
deprivation O
of O
Saddam B-PER

liberty O
contravened O
the O
provisions O
of O
Article B-MISC
14 I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
International I-MISC
Covenant I-MISC
on I-MISC
Civil I-MISC

The O
covenant O
is O
a O
binding O
international O
treaty O
of O
which O
both O
the O
US B-LOC
and O
Iraq B-LOC
are O
signatory O
states O
. O

The O
statements O
said O
that O
the O
opinion O
issued O
by O
the O
working O
group O
on O
September B-MISC
1 I-MISC
of I-MISC
this I-MISC
year I-MISC
concretely O
set O
out O
many O
procedural O
shortcomings O
in O
Saddam B-PER
's O
trial O
. O

These O
included O
the O
lack O
of O
independence O
and O
impartiality O
of O
the O
tribunal O
, O
the O
insufficient O
time O
and O
facilities O
Saddam B-PER
had O
to O
prepare O
his O
defense O
, O
the O
restrictions O
on O
his O
right O
to O
access O
lawyers O
, O
also O
the O
restrictions O
on O
the O
possibilitly O
of O
defense O
lawyers O
in O
calling O
and O
interrogating O
witnesses O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

This O
working O
group O
also O
emphasized O
that O
in O
issuing O
the O
statement O
it O
was O
not O
requesting O
the O
release O
of O
Saddam B-PER
, O
but O
rather O
was O
recommending O
that O
Iraq B-LOC
and O
US B-LOC
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
relevant O
international O
covenants O
, O
reexamine O
whether O
at O
the O
outset O
Saddam B-PER
's O
trial O
conformed O
to O
regulations O
. O

Besides O
the B-MISC
International I-MISC
Covenant I-MISC
on I-MISC
Civil I-MISC
and I-MISC
Political I-MISC
Rights I-MISC
, O
these O
covenants O
also O
include O
the B-MISC
Universal I-MISC
Declaration I-MISC
of I-MISC
Human I-MISC
Rights I-MISC
. O

The O
working O
group O
also O
called O
on O
the B-ORG
Iraqi I-ORG
government I-ORG
to O
refrain O
from O
carrying O
out O
the O
sentence O
of O
death O
by O
hanging O
on O
Saddam B-PER
until O
it O
had O
reexamined O
the O
trial O
procedures O
. O

Saddam B-PER
is O
accused O
of O
carrying O
out O
a O
reprisal O
operation O
against O
local O
villagers O
and O
killing O
143 B-MISC
people O
in O
the O
local O
area O
in O
1982 B-MISC
after O
escaping O
an O
assassination O
in O
the O
village O
of O
Dujail B-LOC

On O
the B-MISC
5th I-MISC
of I-MISC
this I-MISC
month I-MISC
, O
he O
was O
sentenced O
to O
death O
by O
hanging O
by O
the B-ORG
Iraqi I-ORG
High I-ORG
Tribunal I-ORG
. O

Even O
though O
Saddam B-PER
still O
has O
the O
right O
to O
appeal O
to O
the O
appellate O
court O
, O
once O
the O
sentence O
has O
been O
determined O
it O
must O
be O
carried O

that O

The O

up O

That O
development O
may O
not O
be O
as O
significant O
as O
it O
seems O
. O

Joining O
me O
now O
is O
law O
professor O
Rick B-PER
Pildes I-PER
, O
a O
consultant O
to O
NBC B-ORG
News I-ORG
. O

Could O
a O
decision O
from O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
settle O
this O
case O
once O
and O
for O
all O
? O

At O
this O
stage O
, O
any O
decision O
from O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
is O
almost O
certainly O
not O
going O
to O
provide O
a O
final O
resolution O
of O
this O
election O
dispute O
. O

Indeed O
, O
the O
issue O
is O
so O
narrow O
now O
before O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
that O
whichever O
way O
the O
court O
rules O
, O
it O
will O
likely O
have O
only O
the O
most O
marginal O
impact O
on O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
Florida B-LOC
. O

Even O
if O
the O
Bush B-PER
campaign O
prevails O
before O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
, O
it O
simply O
means O
we O
will O
move O
more O
quickly O
into O
the O
contest O
phase O
of O
the O
litigation O
or O
the O
next O
stage O
of O
the O
litigation O
. O

But O
you O
believe O
the O
fact O
that O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
just O
decided O
to O
hear O
this O
case O
is O
a O
partial O
victory O
for O
both O
Bush B-PER
and O
Gore B-PER
. O

It O
is O
a O
partial O
victory O
for O
both O
sides O
. O

For O
the B-MISC
last I-MISC
two I-MISC
weeks I-MISC
, O
the O
central O
constitutional O
argument O
the O
Bush B-PER
campaign O
has O
been O
making O
to O
the O
federal O
courts O
is O
, O
stop O
these O
manual O
recounts O
now O
, O
they O
violate O
the O
Constitution B-MISC
. O

The B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
refused O
to O
hear O
that O
part O
of O
the O
case O
, O
agreeing O
with O
all O
the O
other O
federal O
judges O
who O
have O
unanimously O
held O
that O
this O
is O
not O
the O
proper O
time O
for O
federal O
court O
intervention O
. O

So O
in O
that O
sense O
, O
a O
victory O
for O
the O
Gore B-PER
campaign O
. O

For O
the O
Bush B-PER
campaign O
, O
a O
victory O
in O
the O
willingness O
of O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
to O
play O
some O
role O
in O
overseeing O
the O
Florida B-LOC
system O
and O
the O
Florida B-LOC
judicial O
decision O
making O
process O
. O

Whatever O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
decides O
this O
time O
, O
you O
say O
this O
case O
could O
come O
back O
before O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
again O
? O

John O
, O
if O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
of O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC

is O
to O
play O
a O
final O
and O
decisive O
role O
in O
this O

, O
that O
role O
is O
going O
to O
come O
at O
the O

not O

It O

adding O
: O
`` O

Mr. O

says O
Mrs. O

never O
complained O
to O

that O

`` O
Do O
I O

Mr. O

`` O
Not O

I O

have O

it O

What O
she O
did O
was O
like O
taking O
the O

into O

'' O

Mrs. O
Ward B-PER
says O
that O
when O
the O
cheating O
was O
discovered O
, O
she O
wanted O
to O
avoid O
the O

She O
says O
she O
offered O
Mrs. O

thought O
she O
could O
help O

her O

Mrs. O
Yeargin B-PER
declined O

`` O
She O
said O

The O

these B-MISC

For O
nearly O

The O

generally O

But O
many O

Instead O
, O
they O

a O

the O

stopped O
promoting O
the O

One B-MISC
big O
reason O
: O
thin O

Many O

were O
slow O

As O

the O
mid-1970s B-MISC

the O

They O
are O
better O
able O
to O
get O

those O

Medical O
researchers O
believe O
the O
transplantation O
of O
small O

humans O
could O
help O
treat O

, O
Parkinson O

Huntington O

But O
anti-abortionists O
oppose O
such O
research O
because O
they O
worry O
that O
the O
development O
of O

could O
lead O

aware O

into O
the O
brain O
of O
a O

A O

the O

the O

One B-MISC
official O

even O
directly O
criticized O

who O
is O
normally O
referred O
to O
here O

a O

'' O

The O
Chinese B-MISC
responded O
in O
an O
equally O
undiplomatic O
fashion O

In O
talks O
with O
Mr. O

, O
Chinese B-MISC
leaders O
expressed O
no O

even O
suggested O
that O
the O

In O
a O
meeting O
Tuesday B-MISC

told O
Mr. O

'' O

Despite O
the O

, O
the O
U.S. B-LOC

still O
seem O
to O
be O
looking O
for O
a O
way O

which O
have O
deteriorated O
into O
what O
Mr. O

referred O

as O
`` O
the O

Shortly O
afterwards O
, O
Mr. O

Mr. O

According O
to O
an O
American B-MISC
member O
of O
the O

, O
the O
former O

raised O
a O
number O

issues O
in O
his O
20 B-MISC
hours I-MISC

These O
included O

, O
human O

and O
the O
question O
of O
Mr. O

Mr. O

also O
proposed O
that O

a O

China B-LOC
pulled O
out O

In O
his O

, O
the O

But O
in O
one O
minor O
matter O
, O
Mr. O
Nixon B-PER
appears O
to O
have O
gained O
a O
concession O
. O

In O
a O
meeting O
with O
Premier O
Li B-PER
Peng I-PER
on O
Monday B-MISC

Mr. O

said O
that O

Sure O
enough O

when O

arrived O
at O

two B-MISC

, O
the O
machine O

at O

the O

the O

But O
the O

there O
retained O
their O

a O
large O

Several O
times O

The O

the O

'' O
of O
the B-MISC
1920s I-MISC
, O
Mr. O
Foot B-PER
says O
, O
when O

funds O
grew O
wildly O
popular O
. O

They O
fell O
into O
oblivion O
after O
the O

Unlike O

most O
of O

brings O
to O

that O

or O
soon O
will O
be O

`` O

Behind O
all O
the O
hoopla O
is O
some O
heavy O
- O
duty O
competition O
. O

As O
individual O
investors O
have O
turned O
away O
from O
the O
stock O
market O
over O
the B-MISC
years I-MISC
, O
securities O
firms O
have O
scrambled O
to O
find O
new O
products O
that O
brokers O
find O
easy O
to O
sell O
. O

And O
the O
firms O
are O
stretching O
their O
nets O
far O
and O
wide O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Financial O
planners O
often O
urge O
investors O
to O
diversify O
and O
to O
hold O
a O
smattering O
of O
international O
securities O
. O

And O
many O
emerging O
markets O
have O
outpaced O
more O
mature O
markets O
, O
such O
as O
the O
U.S. B-LOC

Japan B-LOC

Country O
funds O
offer O
an O
easy O
way O
to O
get O
a O
taste O
of O
foreign O
stocks O
without O
the O
hard O
research O
of O
seeking O
out O
individual O
companies O
. O

But O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
much O
to O
get O
burned O
. O

Political O
and O
currency O
gyrations O
can O
whipsaw O
the O
funds O
. O

Another O
concern O
: O
The O
funds O
' O
share O
prices O
tend O
to O
swing O
more O
than O
the O
broader O
market O
. O

When O
the O
stock O
market O
dropped O
nearly B-MISC
7 I-MISC
% I-MISC
Oct. B-MISC
13 I-MISC
, O
for O
instance O
, O
the O
Mexico B-LOC
Fund O
plunged O
about B-MISC
18 I-MISC
% I-MISC
and O
the O
Spain B-LOC
Fund O
fell O
16 B-MISC
% I-MISC
. O

And O
most O
country O
funds O
were O
clobbered O
more O
than O
most O
stocks O
after O
the O
1987 B-MISC
crash O
. O

What O
's O
so O
wild O
about O
the O
funds O
' O
frenzy O
right O
now O
is O
that O
many O
are O
trading O
at O
historically O
fat O
premiums O
to O
the O
value O
of O
their O
underlying O
portfolios O
. O

After O
trading O
at O
an O
average O
discount O
of O
more B-MISC
than I-MISC
20 I-MISC
% I-MISC
in O
late B-MISC
1987 I-MISC
and O
part O
of O
last B-MISC
year I-MISC
, O
country O
funds O
currently O
trade O
at O
an O
average O
premium O
of O
6 B-MISC
% I-MISC
. O

The O
reason O
: O
Share O
prices O
of O
many O
of O
these O
funds O
this B-MISC
year I-MISC
have O
climbed O
much O
more O
sharply O
than O
the O
foreign O
stocks O
they O
hold O
. O

It O
's O
probably O
worth O
paying O
a O
premium O
for O
funds O
that O
invest O
in O
markets O
that O
are O
partially O
closed O
to O
foreign O
investors O
, O
such O
as O
South B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
, O
some O
specialists O
say O
. O

But O
some O
European B-MISC
funds O
recently O
have O
skyrocketed O
; O
Spain B-LOC
Fund O
has O
surged O
to O
a O
startling O
120 B-MISC
% I-MISC
premium O
. O

It O
has O
been O
targeted O
by O
Japanese B-MISC
investors O
as O
a O
good O
long O
- O
term O
play O
tied O
to O
1992 B-MISC
's O
European B-MISC
economic O
integration O
. O

And O
several O
new O
funds O
that O
are O
n't O
even O
fully O
invested O
yet O
have O
jumped O
to O
trade O
at O
big O
premiums O
. O

`` O
I O
'm O
very O
alarmed O
to O
see O
these O
rich O
valuations O
, O
'' O
says O
Smith B-ORG
Barney I-ORG

Mr. O
Porter B-PER
. O

The O
newly O
fattened O

reflect O
the O
increasingly O
global O
marketing O
of O
some O
country O
funds O
, O
Mr. O
Porter B-PER
suggests O
. O

Unlike O
many O
U.S. B-LOC
investors O
, O
those O
in O
Asia B-MISC

foreign O

may O
be O
less O
resistant O
to O
paying O
higher O

`` O
There O
may O
be O
an O
international O
viewpoint O
cast O

the O

'' O
Mr. O
Porter B-PER
says O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
plenty O
of O
U.S. B-LOC
analysts O
and O
money O
managers O
are O
aghast O
at O
the O
lofty O
trading O

of O
some O

. O

They O
argue O
that O
U.S. B-LOC

often O
can O
buy O
American B-MISC
depositary O
receipts O
on O
the O
big O

That O
way O

can O
essentially O

Your O
comments O

we O
had O
discovered O
that O
the O
`` O
principal O
cause O
'' O
of O
homelessness O
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
large O
numbers O
of O
mentally O
ill O
and O
substance O
- O
abusing O
people O
in O
the O

population O
. O

We O
have O
made O
no O
such O
statement O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
most O
mentally O
ill O
people O
and O
most O
alcoholics O
do O
not O
become O
homeless O
. O

The O
`` O
causes O
'' O
of O
homelessness O
are O
poorly O
understood O
and O
complex O
in O
any O
individual O
case O
. O

In O
quoting O
from O
our O
research O
you O
emphasized O
the O
high O
prevalance O
of O
mental O
illness O
and O
alcoholism O
. O

You O
did O
not O
note O
that O
the O
homeless O
people O
we O
examined O
had O
a O
multitude O
of O
physical O
disorders O
in O
addition O
to O
their O
psychiatric O
problems O
and O
substance O
abuse O
. O

They O
suffered O
from O

, O
cardiovascular O
disorders O
, O

, O
infectious O
diseases O
and O
the O

. O

Homeless O
people O
not O
only O
lack O
safety O
, O
privacy O
and O
shelter O
, O
they O
also O
lack O
the O
elementary O
necessities O
of O
nutrition O
, O
cleanliness O
and O
basic O
health O
care O
. O

In O
a O
recent O
report O
, O
the B-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
Medicine I-ORG
pointed O
out O
that O
certain O
health O
problems O
may O
predispose O
a O
person O
to O
homelessness O
, O
others O
may O
be O
a O
consequence O
of O
it O
, O
and O
a O
third B-MISC
category O
is O
composed O
of O
disorders O
whose O
treatment O
is O
difficult O
or O
impossible O
if O
a O
person O
lacks O
adequate O
shelter O
. O

The O
interactions O
between O
health O
and O
homelessness O
are O
complex O
, O
defying O
sweeping O
generalizations O
as O
to O
`` O
cause O
'' O
or O
`` O
effect O
. O
'' O

If O
we O
look O
to O
the O
future O
, O
preventing O
homelessness O
is O
an O
important O
objective O
. O

This O
will O
require O
us O
to O
develop O
a O
much O
more O
sophisticated O
understanding O
of O
the O
dynamics O
of O
homelessness O
than O
we O
currently O
possess O
, O
an O
understanding O
that O
can O
be O
developed O
only O
through O
careful O

`` O

cautioned O
Robert B-PER

, O
one B-MISC
of O
the O

He O
added O
that O
the O
current O
- O
carrying O
capacity O
of O
multi-crystal O
samples O
of O

remains O
too O
low O
for O

Such O
multi-crystal O
materials O
will O
probably O
be O
needed O
for O

. O

Mr. O
van B-PER
Dover I-PER
said O
the O
AT&T B-ORG
team O
created O
the O
desired O
crystal O
changes O
by O
bombarding O
superconductor O
samples O
with O
neutrons O
, O
a O
process O
that O
creates O
some O

may O
not O
be O
feasible O
for O

Still O
, O
scientists O
breathed O
a O
collective O
sigh O
of O
relief O
about O
the O

, O
because O
it O
demonstrates O
how O
to O
overcome O
the O
`` O

'' O
problem O
that O
earlier B-MISC
this I-MISC
year I-MISC
was O
widely O
publicized O
as O
undercutting O
new O

' O
potential O
. O

The O
problem O
involves O
the O
motion O
of O
small O
magnetic O
fields O
within O
superconductor O
crystals O
, O
limiting O
their O
current O

Mr. O

said O
the O

his O

introduced O
apparently O
pins O
the O
magnetic O
fields O

place O
, O
preventing O
them O
from O
lowering O

. O

Mr. O
van B-PER
Dover I-PER
added O
that O
researchers O
are O
trying O
to O
determine O
precisely O
what O
crystal O
changes O
solved O
the O
problem O
. O

Determining O
that O

The O

you O

That O

what O
the O

It O

it O

that O

a O

this O

should O

propagandize O

sounds O

Propaganda O
is O
just O
information O

support O
a O
viewpoint O

and O
the O
beauty O
of O
a O

is O
that O
it O
enables O

Mr. O

I O

the O
right O
to O

I O
had O

, O
arguing O
in O
effect O
that O

right O
to O
print O

information O
is O
n't O
very O
helpful O
if O
I O
have O
no O
right O
to O
get O
the O
information O
. O

But O
the O
court O
disagreed O
. O

`` O
The B-MISC
First I-MISC
Amendment I-MISC
proscribes O
the O

'' O
Judge O
Donald B-PER

`` O
The B-MISC

'' O

So O
now B-MISC
the O
situation O
is O
this O
: O

You O
have O
a O
right O
to O
read O
Voice B-ORG
of I-ORG
America I-ORG
scripts O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
traveling O
to O
Washington B-LOC
every O
week B-MISC
or O
so O
and O
visiting O
the O
Voice B-ORG
office O
during O
business B-MISC
hours I-MISC
. O

I O
have O
a O
right O
to O
print O
those O
scripts O
if O
I O
go O
there O
and O
laboriously O
-- O
but O
no O
longer O
surreptitiously O
-- O
copy O
them O
out O
in O
long O
hand O
. O

But O
neither O
of O
us O
can O
copy O
the O
material O
on O
a O
Xerox B-ORG
machine O
or O
have O
it O
sent O
to O
us O
. O

In O
an B-MISC
era I-MISC
when O
every O
government O
agency O
has O
a O
public O
- O
relations O
machine O
that O
sends O
you O
stuff O
whether O
you O
want O
it O
or O
not O
, O
this O
does O
seem O
odd O
. O

Indeed O
, O
Judge O
O'Brien B-PER
ruled O
that O
`` O
it O
would O
be O
easy O
to O
conclude O
that O
the O

is O
` O
inappropriate O
or O
even O
stupid O
, O
' O
'' O
but O
it O
's O
the O
law O
. O

So O
the O
next O
step O
, O
I O
suspect O
, O
is O
to O
try O
to O
get O
the O
law O
changed O
. O

We O
-LRB- O
I O
assume O
you O
're O
in O
this O
with O
me O
at O
this O
point O

need O
to O
get O
three B-MISC
words O
-- O
`` O

only O

-- O
eliminated O
from O
the O
law O

`` O
I O

Above O

Mr. O

the O

`` O

`` O
It O

the O

Mr. O

observed O
that O
the O

`` O

The O

But O
this O
case O
is O
a O
stark O
lesson O
in O
how O
the O
failures O
of O
the O
traditional O
policy O
- O
making O
process O
have O
left O
the O
courts O
as O
the O
only O
forum O
this O
country O
has O
to O
debate O
risk O
, O
technology O
and O
innovation O
. O

Too O
often O
now O
, O
a O
single B-MISC
court O
decision O
becomes O
the O
precedent O
for O
other O
, O
less O
compelling O
cases O
. O

From B-MISC
the I-MISC
1940s I-MISC
until I-MISC
1971 I-MISC
, O
some B-MISC
two I-MISC
million I-MISC
women O
took O
the O
synthetic O
hormone O
diethylstilbestrol O
-LRB- O
DES O
-RRB- O
to O
prevent O
miscarriages O
and O
morning O
sickness O
. O

The O
drug O
was O
approved O
by O
the B-ORG
Food I-ORG
and I-ORG
Drug I-ORG
Administration I-ORG
and O
marketed O
by O
some B-MISC
300 I-MISC
pharmaceutical O
companies O
, O
often O
under O
generic O
labels O
. O

In O
the B-MISC
1970s I-MISC
, O
scientists O
reported O
cancer O
cases O
among O
the O
daughters O
of O
DES O
users O
. O

The O
cases O
quickly O
went O
to O
court O
, O
but O
the O
mothers O
of O
several B-MISC
thousand I-MISC
DES O
plaintiffs O
could O
n't O
recall O
whose O
brand O
they O
used O
. O

Beginning O
in O
1980 B-MISC
, O
courts O
in O
several O
states O
including O
California B-LOC
and O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
decided O
to O
suspend O
the O
common O
- O
law O
rule O
that O
plaintiffs O
must O
prove O
that O
the O
defendants O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
are O
liable O
. O

Courts O
made O
the O
assumption O
that O
all O
DES O
pills O
were O
essentially O
the O
same O
, O
and O
created O
a O
market O
- O
share O
test O
so O
that O
damages O
would O
be O
assessed O
against O
drug O
makers O
in O
the O
proportion O
of O
their O
share O
of O
the O
original O
sales O
. O

This O
has O
some O
logic O
. O

Drug O
makers O
should O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
duck O
liability O
because O
people O
could O
n't O
identify O
precisely O
which O
identical O
drug O
was O
used O
. O

But O
courts O
quickly O
tumbled O
down O
a O
slippery O
slope O
. O

Just O
as O
all O
plaintiffs O
are O
not O
alike O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
DES O
defendants O
marketed O
the O
drugs O
differently O
and O
may O
have O
offered O
different O
warranties O
. O

The O
ultimate O
result O
came O
in O
Hymowitz B-PER
v. O
Lilly B-ORG
, O
where O
the O
highest O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
court O
expanded O
the O
market O
- O
share O
approach O
for O
the O
first O
time O
to O
say O
that O
drug O
makers O
that O
could O
prove O
Mindy B-PER
Hymowitz I-PER
's I-PER
mother O
did O
n't O
use O
their O
pill O
must O
still O
pay O
their O
share O
of O
any O
damages O
. O

But O
as O
Duke B-ORG
University I-ORG
law O
professor O
William B-PER
Van I-PER
Alstyne I-PER
notes O
, O
by O
this O
reasoning O
a O
defendant O
could O
be O
held O
liable O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
for O
a O
bad O
apple O
even O
if O
he O
sold O
all O
his O
apples O
in O
California B-LOC
. O

Despite O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
's I-ORG
refusal O
to O
hear O
the O
case O
, O
there O
are O
serious O
constitutional O
issues O
of O
due O
process O
and O
uncompensated O
takings O
from O
the O
defendants O
. O

The O
big O
problem O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
there O
's O
no O
guarantee O
that O
this O
reasoning O
will O
be O
limited O
to O
DES O
or O
to O
drugs O
. O

The O
problem O
here O
goes O
well O
beyond O
twisting O
legal O
doctrine O
. O

The B-ORG
California I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
last B-MISC
year I-MISC
reversed O
direction O
to O
make O
it O
much O
harder O
to O
win O
DES O
cases O
because O
the O
justices O
saw O
how O
all O
the O
pharmaceutical O
litigation O
has O
chilled O
the O
introduction O
of O
new O
drugs O
. O

The O
court O
rejected O
strict O
liability O
for O
prescription O
drugs O
, O
citing O
the O
huge O
, O
hidden O
social O
costs O
. O

`` O
Public O
policy O
favors O
the O
development O
and O
marketing O
of O
beneficial O
new O
drugs O
, O
even O
though O
some O
risks O
, O
perhaps O
serious O
ones O
, O
might O
accompany O
their O
introduction O
because O
drugs O
can O
save O
lives O
and O
reduce O
pain O
and O
suffering O
, O
'' O
the O
unanimous O
court O
said O
. O

The O
California B-LOC
justices O
noted O
that O
the O
fear O
of O
litigation O
already O
forced O
the O
only O
remaining O
anti-morning O
- O
sickness O
drug O
, O
Bendectin B-MISC
, O
off O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
market O
. O

This O
raises O
the O
key O
issue O
: O
What O
to O
do O
about O
people O
who O
suffer O
serious O
injuries O
from O
beneficial O
drugs O
? O

We O
now O
know O
that O
holding O
drug O
makers O
liable O
where O
there O
's O
no O
evidence O
that O
they O
or O
anyone O
else O
knew O
of O
any O
risks O
only O
means O
the O
drugs O
wo O
n't O
be O
available O
to O
anyone O
. O

As O
liability O
expert O
Peter B-PER
Huber I-PER
tells O
us O
, O
after O
the O
Hymowitz B-PER
case O
, O
if O
any O
drug O
maker O
introduces O
an O
anti-miscarriage O
drug O
`` O
it O
's O
time O
to O
sell O
that O
company O
's O
stock O
short O
. O
'' O

We O
also O
know O
that O
the O
tort O
system O
is O
a O
lousy O
way O
to O
compensate O
victims O
anyway O
; O
some O
win O
the O
legal O
lottery O
, O
others O
get O
much O
less O
and O
contingency O
- O
fee O
lawyers O
take O
a O
big O
cut O
either O
way O
. O

DES O
daughters O
and O
other O
victims O
of O
drugs O
would O
be O
better O
off O
if O
their O
cases O
were O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
courts O
. O

Congress B-ORG
could O
create O
a O
compensation O
program O
to O
help O
such O
victims O
while O
protecting O
the O
national O
interest O
in O
encouraging O
new O
drugs O
. O

But O
a O
1986 B-MISC
law O
that O
supposedly O
replaced O
lawsuits O
over O
children O
's O
vaccines O
with O
a O
compensation O
fund O
has O
predictably O
led O
to O
even O
more O
litigation O
. O

Everyone O
by O
now O
understands O
that O
Congress B-ORG
is O
utterly O
incapable O
of O
writing O
legislation O
to O
help O
deserving O
people O
without O
its O
becoming O
some O
billion B-MISC
- I-MISC
dollar I-MISC
morass O
. O

We O
have O
no O
doubt O
this O
is O
one O
reason O
judges O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
and O
justices O
on O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
are O
willing O
to O
trash O
the O
law O
in O
the O
DES O
cases O
. O

They O
must O
figure O
that O
justice O
has O
to O
get O
done O
by O
somebody O
, O
but O
know O
it O
wo O
n't O

done O
by O
Congress B-ORG

The O

the O

that O

the O

the O

Although O
the O

it O

Corn O
prices O
have O
been O
sluggish O
this O
fall O
despite O
the O
huge O
Soviet B-MISC
orders O
because O
the O

With O

however O
, O
some O

are O

that O

Farmers O
are O
in O
the O
best O
position O
of O
many B-MISC
years I-MISC
to O
push O
up O

Because O
the O

reduced O

, O
they O
have O
more O
than O
enough O
storage O
space O

that O
permits O
them O

Although O

The O

, O
which O
is O
expected O
today B-MISC

is O
described O
by O
government O

as O
significantly O
weaker O

the O
Bush B-PER

plan O
to O
cut O

that O

The O

up O
to O
$ B-MISC
4 I-MISC

The O
proposal O
comes O
as O
a O
surprise O
even O
to O
administration O

and O
temporarily O
throws O
into O

the O
House B-ORG

Mr. O

People O
close O

said O
Mr. O

appears O
to O
guarantee O
only O
an O

seven B-MISC

though O
additional O

could O
be O
ordered O
later O

Mr. O

legislative O
package O
promises O
to O
cut O

by O
10 B-MISC

Although O
final O
details O
were O

the O

abandon O
the O
president O

proposal O
for O
a O
cap O
on O

' O
sulfur O

. O

That O
proposal O
had O
been O
hailed O
by O
environmentalists O
but O
despised O
by O
utilities O
because O
they O
feared O
it O
would O
limit O
their O
growth O

It O
also O
would O
junk O
an O
innovative O
market O
- O
based O
system O
for O
trading O
emissions O

among O

. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
believed O
to O
offer O
a O
cost O
- O
sharing O
mechanism O
that O
would O
help O
subsidize O
the O
clean O

up O
costs O
for O
the O
dirtiest O

in O
the O
country O
, O
sparing O
their O
customers O
from O
exorbitant O
jumps O
in O
their O
electric O

. O

The O
administration O
, O
sticking O
to O
its O
vow O
of O
avoiding O
tax O
increases O
, O
has O
staunchly O
opposed O
cost O

. O

Mr. O
Dingell B-PER

staff O
was O
expected O
to O
present O
its O
acid O
- O
rain O
alternative O
to O
other O
committee O
members O
, O
apparently O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
appease O
Midwestern B-MISC
lawmakers O
from O
high O
- O
polluting O
states O
who O
insist O
on O
cost O
- O
sharing O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
clear O
, O
however O
, O
whether O
support O
for O
the O
proposal O
will O
be O
broad O
enough O

pose O
a O
serious O
challenge O
to O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG

While O
the O
new O

might O
appeal O
to O
the O

, O
it O
might O
not O
win O
the O

Congress B-ORG
learned O
during O
the O
Reagan B-PER
administration O
that O

uttering O
again O
and O
again O
the O

seven B-MISC
words O
: O
`` O
Provided O
, O
that O
no O

shall O
be O
spent O
... O
. O
'' O

This O
phrase O
once O
again O
is O
found O
throughout O
the O
many O
appropriations O
bills O
now O
moving O
through O
Congress B-ORG

It O
signals O
Congress B-ORG
's O
attempt O
, O
under O
the O
pretext O
of O
guarding O
the O
public O
purse O
, O
to O
deny O
the O
president O
the O
funding O
necessary O
to O
execute O
certain O
of O
his O
duties O
and O
prerogatives O
specified O
in O
Article B-MISC
II I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Constitution I-MISC
. O

This O
species O
of O
congressional O
action O
is O
predicated O
on O
an O
interpretation O
of O
the O
appropriations O
clause O
that O
is O
erroneous O
and O
unconstitutional O
. O

The O
appropriations O
clause O
states O
that O
`` O
No O

be O
drawn O
from O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
, O
but O
in O
Consequence O
of O

by O
Law O
... O
. O
'' O

The O
prevailing O
interpretation O
of O
the O
clause O
on O
Capitol B-ORG
Hill I-ORG
is O
that O
it O
gives O
Congress B-ORG
an O
omnipresent O
veto O
over O
every O
conceivable O
action O
of O
the O
president O
through O
the O
ability O
to O
withhold O
funding O
. O

This O
interpretation O
was O
officially O
endorsed O
by O
Congress B-ORG
in O
1987 B-MISC
in O
the O
Iran B-LOC
- O
Contra O
Report O

As O
partisans O
of O
congressional O
power O
understand O
, O
a O
`` O
power O
of O
the O
purse O
'' O
so O
broadly O
construed O
would O
emasculate O
the O
presidency O
and O
swallow O
the O
principle O
of O
separation O
of O
powers O
. O

It O
is O
not O
supported O
by O
the O
text O
or O
history O
of O
the O
Constitution B-MISC
. O

The O
framers O
hardly O
discussed O
the O
appropriations O
clause O
at O
the B-MISC
Constitutional I-MISC
Convention I-MISC
of I-MISC
1787 I-MISC
, O
according O
to O
Madison B-PER
's O
notes O
. O

To O
the O
extent O
they O
did O
, O
their O
concern O
was O
to O
ensure O
fiscal O
accountability O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
framers O
believed O
that O
the O
nation O
needed O
a O
unitary O
executive O
with O
the O
independence O
and O
resources O
to O
perform O
the O
executive O
functions O
that O
the B-ORG
Confederation I-ORG
Congress I-ORG
had O
performed O
poorly O
under O
the B-MISC
Articles I-MISC
of I-MISC
Confederation I-MISC
. O

It O
would O
contradict O
that O
objective O
if O
the O
appropriations O
clause O
-LRB- O
technically O
a O
limitation O
on O
legislative O
power O
-RRB- O
could O
be O
read O
as O
placing O
the O
president O
on O
Congress B-ORG
's O
short O
leash O
, O
making O
the O
executive O
consist O
of O
the O
president O
and O
every O
member O
of O
Congress B-ORG
. O

As O
it O
went O
to O
the O
conference O
panel O
now O
deliberating O
, O
the O
appropriations O
bill O
for O
the O
executive O
office O
of O
the O
president O
for O
fiscal B-MISC
1990 I-MISC
contained O
some O
breathtaking O
attempts O
by O
Congress B-ORG
to O
rewrite O
the O
Constitution B-MISC
under O
the O
pretext O
of O
protecting O
the O
public O
's O
money O
. O

During O
the B-MISC
coming I-MISC
weeks I-MISC
, O
President O
Bush B-PER
must O
decide O
whether O
to O
veto O
the O
bills O
containing O
them O
-- O
or O
, O
alternatively O
, O
to O
sign O
these O
bills O
into O
law O
with O
a O
statement O
declaring O
their O
intrusions O
on O
executive O
power O
to O
be O
in O
violation O
of O
Article B-MISC
II I-MISC
, O
and O
thus O
void O
and O
severable O
. O

The O
1990 B-MISC
appropriations O
legislation O
attempts O
to O
strip O
the O
president O
of O
his O
powers O
to O
make O
certain O
appointments O
as O
provided O
by O
Article B-MISC
II I-MISC
. O

Article B-MISC
II I-MISC
places O
on O
the O
president O
the O
duty O
to O
nominate O
, O
`` O
and O
by O
and O
with O
the O
Advice O
and O
Consent O
of O
the O
Senate B-ORG
'' O
appoint O
, O
ambassadors O
, O
judges O
, O
and O
other O
officers O
of O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
. O

It O
also O
empowers O
the O
president O
to O
make O
recess O
appointments O
, O
without O
Senate B-ORG
approval O
: O
`` O
The O
President O
shall O
have O
Power O
to O
fill O
up O
all O
Vacancies O
that O
may O
happen O
during O
the O
Recess O
of O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
by O
granting O
Commissions O
which O
shall O
expire O
at O
the O
End O
of O
their O
next O
Session O
. O
'' O

Yet O
Section B-MISC
605 I-MISC
of O
the O
appropriations O
bill O
for O
the O
executive O
office O
provides O
: O
`` O
No O
part O
of O
any O
appropriation O
for O
the B-MISC
current I-MISC
fiscal I-MISC
year I-MISC
contained O
in O
this O
or O
any O
other O
Act O
shall O
be O
paid O
to O
any O
person O
for O
the O
filling O
of O
any O
position O
for O
which O
he O
or O
she O
has O
been O
nominated O
after O
the O
Senate B-ORG
has O
voted O
not O
to O
approve O
the O
nomination O
of O
said O
person O
. O
'' O

Thus O
, O
with O
one O
brief O
passage O
in O
an O
appropriations O
bill O
, O
Congress B-ORG
repeals O
the O
president O
's O
power O
to O
make O
recess O
appointments O
under O
Article B-MISC
II I-MISC
. O

Section B-MISC
605 I-MISC
also O
imposes O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
on O
the O
president O
's O
ability O
to O
nominate O
candidates O
of O
his O
choosing O
. O

The O
language O
of O
the O
appropriations O
rider O
implies O
that O
any O
nomination O
to O
any O
position O
of O
a O
rejected O
nominee O
will O
result O
in O
the O
president O
being O
denied O
funding O
to O
pay O
that O
person O
's O
salary O
. O

The O
president O
could O
probably O
not O
avoid O
this O
restriction O
by O
choosing O
people O
willing O
to O
serve O
without O
pay O
, O
because O
the B-MISC
Anti-Deficiency I-MISC
Act I-MISC
prohibits O
voluntary O
service O
to O
the O
government O
. O

The O
1990 B-MISC
appropriations O
bills O
also O
contain O
a O
number O
of O
`` O
muzzling O
'' O
provisions O
that O
violate O
the O
recommendation O
clause O
in O
Article B-MISC
II I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Constitution I-MISC
. O

Muzzling O
provisions O
, O
which O
might O
be O
called O
`` O
blindfold O
laws O
'' O
as O
well O
, O
prevent O
the O
executive O
branch O
from O
even O
looking O
at O
certain O
policy O
options O
, O
let O
alone O
from O
recommending O
them O
to O
Congress B-ORG
. O

Such O
laws O
violate O
the O
provision O
in O
Article B-MISC
II I-MISC
that O
requires O
the O
president O
to O
make O
recommendations O
to O
Congress B-ORG
, O
but O
which O
gives O
the O
president O
the O
discretion O
to O
select O
the O
subject O
matter O
of O
those O
recommendations O
. O

Typically O
, O
these O
laws O
seek O
to O
prevent O
executive O
branch O
officials O
from O
inquiring O
into O
whether O
certain O
federal O
programs O
make O
any O
economic O
sense O
or O
proposing O
more O
market O
- O
oriented O
alternatives O
to O
regulations O
. O

Probably O
the O
most O
egregious O
example O
is O
a O
proviso O
in O
the O
appropriations O
bill O
for O
the O
executive O
office O
that O
prevents O
the O
president O
's O
Office B-ORG
of I-ORG
Management I-ORG
and I-ORG
Budget I-ORG
from O
subjecting O
agricultural O
marketing O
orders O
to O
any O
cost O
- O
benefit O
scrutiny O
. O

There O
is O
something O
inherently O
suspect O
about O
Congress B-ORG
's O
prohibiting O
the O
executive O
from O
even O
studying O
whether O
public O
funds O
are O
being O
wasted O
in O
some O
favored O
program O
or O
other O
. O

Perhaps O
none O
of O
the O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
contained O
in O
the O
appropriations O
bills O
for O
fiscal B-MISC
1990 I-MISC
better O
illustrates O
Congress B-ORG
's O
attempt O
to O
usurp O
executive O
power O
than O
Section B-MISC
609 I-MISC
of O
the O
executive O
- O
office O
bill O
: O
`` O
None O
of O
the O
funds O
made O

adopted O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
applicable O
law O
of O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC

'' O

This O
provision O
amounts O
to O
a O
legislative O
veto O
over O
the O
president O
's O
execution O
of O
the O
law O
, O
since O
a O
one B-MISC

said O
to O

even O
though O
it O
would O
require O
neither O
bicameral O
action O
in O
Congress B-ORG
nor O
presentation O
to O
the O
president O
for O
his O
signature O
or O
veto O
. O

The B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
's I-ORG
decision O
in O
INS B-ORG
v. O
Chadha B-PER
held O
that O
legislative O
vetoes O
are O
unconstitutional O
. O

President O
Bush B-PER
should O
veto O
appropriations O
acts O
that O
contain O
these O
kinds O
of O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
on O
the O
president O

ability O
to O
discharge O
his O
duties O
and O
exercise O
his O
prerogatives O
. O

If O
President O
Bush B-PER
fails O
to O
do O
so O
in O
his O
first B-MISC
year I-MISC
, O
he O
will O
invite O
Congress B-ORG

for O
the O

of O
his O
presidency O
, O
to O
rewrite O
Article B-MISC
II I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Constitution I-MISC
to O
suit O
its O
purposes O
. O

What O
becomes O
custom O
in O
the O
Bush B-PER
administration O
will O
only O
become O
more O
difficult O
for O
future O
presidents O
, O
including O
Democrats B-MISC
, O
to O
undo O
. O

President O
Reagan B-PER
learned O
that O
lesson O
. O

By O
1987 B-MISC
, O
then O
- O
Speaker O
Jim B-PER
Wright I-PER
was O
discussing O
arms O
control O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
with O
Mikhail B-PER
Gorbachev I-PER
and O
then O
attempting O
to O
direct O
the O
president O
, O
through O
an O
appropriations O
rider O
, O
to O
treat O
the O
Soviets B-MISC
as O
though O
the O
Senate B-ORG
had O
ratified O
SALT B-MISC
II I-MISC
. O

If O
a O
veto O
is O
unworkable O
because O
it O
would O
leave O
part O
of O
the O
executive O
branch O
unfunded O
, O
the O
president O
could O
sign O
the O
appropriations O
bills O
into O
law O
and O
assert O
a O
power O
of O
excision O
, O
declaring O
the O
rider O
restricting O
his O
Article B-MISC
II I-MISC
powers O
to O
be O
unconstitutional O
and O
severable O
. O

The O
Constitution B-MISC
does O
not O
expressly O
give O
the O
president O
such O
power O
. O

However O
, O
the O
president O
does O
have O
a O
duty O
not O
to O
violate O
the O
Constitution B-MISC
. O

The O
question O
is O
whether O
his O
only O
means O
of O
defense O
is O
the O
veto O
. O

Excision O
of O
appropriations O
riders O
that O
trespass O
on O
the O
president O
's O
duties O
and O
prerogative O
under O
Article B-MISC
II I-MISC
would O
be O
different O
from O
the O
line O
- O
item O
veto O
. O

As O
discussed O
in O
the O
context O
of O
controlling O
federal O
spending O
, O
the O
line O
- O
item O
veto O
is O
characterized O
as O
a O
way O
for O
the O
president O
to O
excise O
perfectly O
constitutional O
provisions O
in O
a O
spending O
bill O
that O
are O
objectionable O
merely O
because O
they O
conflict O
with O
his O
policy O
objectives O
. O

The O
excision O
of O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
in O
an O
appropriations O
bill O
would O
be O
a O
power O
of O
far O
more O
limited O
applicability O
. O

One O
could O
argue O
that O
it O
is O
not O
an O
assertion O
of O
a O
item O
veto O
at O
all O
for O
the O
president O
, O
by O
exerting O
a O
power O
of O

however O
, O
the O

it O

Why O

Friday B-MISC
's O
190 B-MISC
- O
point O
plunge O
in O

does O
not O
come O
atop O
the O
climate O
of O
anxiety O
that O
dominated O
financial O
markets O
just O
prior O
to O
their O
1987 B-MISC
October I-MISC
crash O
, O
and O
mechanisms O
have O
been O
put O
in O
place O
to O
keep O
markets O
more O
orderly O
. O

Still O
, O
the O
lesson O
is O
about O
the O
same O
: O
On O
Friday B-MISC
the I-MISC
13th I-MISC
, O
the O
market O
was O
spooked O
by O
Washington B-LOC
. O

The O
consensus O
along O
the O
street O
seems O
to O
be O
that O
the O
plunge O
was O
triggered O
by O
the O
financing O
problems O
of O
the O
UAL B-ORG
takeover O
, O
and O
it O
's O
certainly O
true O
the O
rout O
began O
immediately O
after O
the O
UAL B-ORG
trading O
halt O
. O

Still O
, O
the O
consensus O
seems O
almost O
as O
wide O
that O
one B-MISC
faltering O
bid O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
write O
down O
the O
value O
of O
all O
U.S. B-LOC
business O
. O

This O
observation O
leads O
us O
to O
another O
piece O
of O
news O
moving O
on O
the O
Dow B-ORG
Jones I-ORG
ticker O
shortly O
before O
the O
downturn O
: O
the O
success O
of O
Senate B-ORG
Democrats B-MISC
in O
stalling O
the O
capital O
gains O
tax O
cut O
. O

The O
real O
value O
of O
all O
shares O
, O
after O
all O
, O
is O
directly O
impacted O
by O
the O
tax O
on O
any O
profits O
-LRB- O
all O
the O
more O
so O
given O
the O

on O

that O

are O
not O
`` O
ordinary O

'' O
-RRB- O
. O

And O
market O
expectations O
clearly O
have O
been O
raised O
by O
the O
capital O
gains O
victory O
in O
the O
House B-ORG
last B-MISC
month I-MISC
. O

An B-MISC
hour I-MISC
before O
Friday B-MISC
's O
plunge O
, O
that O
provision O
was O
stripped O
from O
the O
tax O
bill O
, O
leaving O
it O
with O
$ B-MISC
5.4 I-MISC
billion I-MISC
in O
tax O
increases O
without O
a O
capital O
gains O
cut O
. O

There O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
to O
be O
said O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
for O
stripping O
the O
garbage O
out O
of O
the O
reconciliation O
bill O
. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
good O
thing O
if O
Congress B-ORG
started O
to O
decide O
issues O
one O
- O
by O
- O
one B-MISC
on O
their O
individual O
merits O
without O
trickery O
. O

For O
one B-MISC
thing O
, O
no O
one O
doubts O
that O
the O
capital O
gains O
cut O
would O
pass O
on O
an O
up O
- O
or O
- O
down O
vote O
. O

Since O
Senate B-ORG
leaders O
have O
so O
far O
fogged O
it O
up O
with O
procedural O
smokescreens O
, O
promises O
of O
a O
cleaner O
bill O
are O
suspect O
. O

Especially O
so O
since O
President O
Bush B-PER
has O
been O
weakened O
by O
the O
Panama B-LOC
fiasco O
. O

To O
the O
extent O
that O
the O
UAL B-ORG
troubles O
contributed O
to O
the O
plunge O
, O
they O
are O
another O
instance O
of O
Washington B-LOC
's O
sticky O
fingers O
. O

As O
the O
best O
opportunities O
for O
corporate O
restructurings O
are O
exhausted O
of O
course O
, O
at O
some O
point O
the O
market O
will O
start O
to O
reject O
them O
. O

But O
the O
airlines O
are O
scarcely O
a O
clear O
case O
, O
given O
anti-takeover O
mischief O
by O
Secretary O
of O
Transportation B-ORG
Skinner B-PER
, O
who O
professes O
to O
believe O
safety O
will O
be O
compromised O
if O
KLM B-ORG
and O
British B-ORG
Airways I-ORG
own O
interests O
in O
companies O
that O
fly O
airplanes O
. O

Worse O
, O
Congress B-ORG
has O
started O
to O
jump O
on O
the O
Skinner B-PER
bandwagon O
. O

James B-PER
Oberstar I-PER
, O
the O
Minnesota B-LOC
Democrat B-MISC
who O
chairs O
the O
Public B-ORG
Works I-ORG

Transportation I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
's I-ORG
aviation O
subcommittee O
, O
has O
put O
an O
anti-airline O
takeover O
bill O
on O
supersonic O
speed O
so O
that O
it O
would O
be O
passed O
in O
time O
to O
affect O
the O
American B-ORG
and O
United B-ORG
Air I-ORG
Lines I-ORG
bids O
. O

It O
would O
give O
Mr. O
Skinner B-PER
up B-MISC
to I-MISC
50 I-MISC
days I-MISC
to O
`` O
review O
'' O
any O
bid O
for O

with O

1 I-MISC

. O

So O
the O
UAL B-ORG
deal O
has O
problems O
, O
and O
the O

loses O
190 B-MISC

final I-MISC
13th I-MISC

In O
the O

episode O
we O
learn O
that O
Michelle B-PER

a O
junior O
bond O

, O
has O
indeed O
pulled O
off O
another B-MISC

Michelle B-PER
blabs O
about O
it O
to O
a O

over O

Little O
chance O
that O
Shane B-ORG
Longman I-ORG
is O
going O
to O
recoup O
today B-MISC
. O

Traders O
spend O
the O
morning B-MISC
frantically O
selling O
bonds O
, O
in O
the O
belief O
that O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
monthly B-MISC
trade O
figures O
will O
look O
lousy O
. O

Ah O
, O
perfidious O
Columbia B-LOC
! O

The O
trade O
figures O
turn O
out O
well O
, O
and O
all O
those O
recently O
unloaded O
bonds O
spurt O
in O
price O
. O

So O
much O
for O
anticipating O
the O
market O
by O
a B-MISC
fraction I-MISC
of I-MISC
a I-MISC
second I-MISC
. O

And O
a O
large O
slice O
of O
the O
first B-MISC
episode O
is O
devoted O
to O
efforts O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
some O
nearly O
worthless O
Japanese B-MISC
bonds O
-LRB- O
since O
when O
is O
anything O
Japanese B-MISC
nearly O
worthless O
nowadays O
? O
-RRB- O
. O

Surprisingly O
, O
Shane B-ORG
Longman I-ORG
survives O
the B-MISC
week I-MISC
, O
only O
to O
have O
a O
senior O
executive O
innocently O
bumble O
his O
way O
into O
becoming O
the O
target O
of O
a O
criminal O
insider O
trading O
investigation O
. O

Instead O
of O
closing O
ranks O
to O
protect O
the O
firm O
's O
reputation O
, O
the O
executive O
's O
internal O
rivals O
, O
led O
by O
a O
loutish O
American B-MISC
, O
demand O
his O
resignation O
. O

The O
plot O
is O
thwarted O
when O
the O
firm O
's O
major O
stockholder O
, O
kelp O
farming O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
globe O
, O
hurries O
home O
to O
support O
the O
executive O
. O

But O
the O
investigation O
continues O
. O

If O
you O
can O
swallow O
the O
premise O
that O
the O
rewards O
for O
such O
ineptitude O
are O
six B-MISC
- O
figure O
salaries O
, O
you O
still O
are O
left O
puzzled O
, O
because O
few O
of O
the O
yuppies O
consume O
very O
conspicuously O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
few O
consume O
much O
of O
anything O
. O

Two B-MISC
share O
a O
house O
almost O
devoid O
of O
furniture O
. O

Michelle B-PER
lives O
in O
a O
hotel O
room O
, O
and O
although O
she O
drives O
a O
canary O
- O
colored O
Porsche B-ORG
, O
she O
has O
n't O
time O
to O
clean O
or O
repair O
it O
; O
the O
beat O
- O
up O
vehicle O
can O
be O
started O
only O
with O
a O
huge O
pair O
of O
pliers O
because O
the O
ignition O
key O
has O
broken O
off O
in O
the O
lock O
. O

And O
it O
takes O
Declan B-PER
, O
the O
obligatory O
ladies O
' O
man O
of O
the O
cast O
, O
until O
the O
third B-MISC
episode O
to O
get O
past O
first B-MISC
base O
with O
any O
of O
his O
prey O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
explanation O
for O
these O
anomalies O
is O
that O
class O
- O
conscious O
Britain B-LOC
is O
n't O
ready O
to O
come O
to O
terms O
with O
the O
wealth O
created O
by O
the O
Thatcherian O
free O
- O
enterprise O
regime O
. O

After O
all O
, O
this O
is O
n't O
old O
money O
, O
but O
new O
money O
, O
and O
in O
many O
cases O
, O
young O
money O
. O

This O
attitude O
is O
clearly O
illustrated O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
Max B-PER
, O
the O
trading O
room O
's O
most O
flamboyant O
character O

Yuppily O
enough O
, O
he O
lives O
in O
a O
lavishly O
furnished O
converted O
church O
, O
wears O
designer O
clothes O
and O
drives O
an O
antique O
car O
. O

But O
apparently O
to O
make O
him O
palatable O
, O
even O
lovable O
, O
to O
the O
masses O
, O
the O
script O
inflates O
pony O
- O
tailed O
Max B-PER
into O
an O
eccentric O
genius O
, O
master O
of O
11 B-MISC
Chinese B-MISC
dialects O
. O

He O
takes O
his O
wash O
to O
the O
laundromat O
, O
where O
he O
meets O
a O
punky O
French B-MISC
girl O
who O
dupes O
him O
into O
providing O
a O
home O
for O
her O
pet O
piranha O
and O
then O
promptly O
steals O
his O
car O
and O
dumps O
it O

The O

of O

, O
not O
as O
an O
aspersion O
on O
the O

of O

Rather O
, O
it O
is O
born O
of O
frustration O

to O
combat O
constantly O
changing O
strains O
of O
a O

idea O
that O

'' O
a O

with O

at O

. O

Why O
does O
the O

virus O
keep O
coming O
back O
? O

Perhaps O
it O
is O
because O
utopian O
nostalgia O
evokes O
both O
military O

and O
the O
social O

. O

If O
only O
we O

A B-MISC
quarter I-MISC
of I-MISC
a I-MISC
century I-MISC
ago I-MISC
national O
service O
was O
promoted O
as O
a O
way O
of O
curing O
the O
manifest O
inequities O
of O
the O
draft O
-- O
by O
, O
of O
all O
things O
, O
expanding O
the O
draft O
. O

Those O
of O
us O
who O
resisted O
the O
idea O
then O
suspect O
today B-MISC
that O
an O
obligation O
of O
government O
service O
for O
all O
young O
people O
is O
still O
the O
true O
long O
- O
term O
aim O
of O
many O
national O
- O
service O
backers O
, O
despite O
their O
protests O
that O
present O
plans O
contain O
no O
coercion O
. O

Choice O
of O
the O
volunteer O
military O
in O
the B-MISC
1970s I-MISC
seemed O
to O
doom O
national O
service O
as O
much O
as O
the O
draft O
. O

But O
the O
virus O
was O
kept O
alive O
in O
sociology O
departments O
until O
a B-MISC
couple I-MISC
of I-MISC
years I-MISC
ago I-MISC
, O
when O
it O
again O
was O
let O
loose O
. O

This O
time O
it O
attempted O
to O
invade O
two B-MISC
connected O
problems O
, O
the O
rising O
cost O
of O
higher O
education O
and O
the O
rising O
expense O
to O
the O
federal O
government O
of O
educational O
grants O
and O
loans O
. O

Why O
not O
keep O
and O
even O
expand O
the O
loans O
and O
grants O
, O
the O
advocates O
reasoned O
, O
but O
require O
some O
form O
of O
service O
from O
each O
recipient O
? O

Military O
service O
, O
moreover O
, O
could O
be O
a O
national O
- O
service O
option O

Thus O
, O
undoubtedly O
it O
was O
hoped O
that O
the O
new O
strain O
of O
national O
service O
would O
prove O
contagious O
, O
infecting O
patriotic O
conservatives O
, O
pay O

count O
on O

For O
20 B-MISC

, O
federal O

barred O

And O
for O
six B-MISC

, O
NBC B-ORG
, O
ABC B-ORG

have O
negotiated O
with O

But O
with O

up O
U.S. B-LOC

the O

are O
pressing O
their O

harder O

ever O
. O

They O
hope O
the O
foreign O

will O
divide O
the O

prod O
Congress B-ORG
to O
push O

Even O
if O

find O
another O

`` O

'' O
an O
NBC B-ORG

says O

But O
the O

push O
may O
only O
aggravate O
an O
increasingly O
bitter O

that O

Mr. O
Kaye B-PER
took O
notice O
in O
1987 B-MISC
when O
Sony B-ORG
, O
in O
a O
classic O
example O
of O
market O
segmentation O
, O
changed O
the O
plastic O
skin O
and O
buttons O
on O
the O
famous O
Walkman B-MISC
line O
of O
portable O
audio O
equipment O
and O
created O
the O
My B-MISC
First I-MISC
Sony I-MISC
line O
for O
children O
. O

The O
brightly O
colored O
new O
products O
looked O
more O
like O
toys O
than O
the O
adult O
models O
. O

-LRB- O
In O
court O
papers O
, O
Sony B-ORG
says O
it O
has O
spent O
more B-MISC
than I-MISC
$ I-MISC
3 I-MISC
million I-MISC
to O
promote O
the O
line O
, O
with O
resulting O
sales O
of O
over B-MISC
a I-MISC
million I-MISC
units O
. O
-RRB- O

Sony B-ORG
found O
a O
new O
market O
niche O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Kaye B-PER
figured O
that O
its O
prices O
left O
plenty O
of O
room O
for O
a O
lower O
- O
priced O
competitor O
. O

His O
products O
are O
n't O
exact O
copies O
of O
Sony B-ORG
's O
but O
strongly O
resemble O
them O
in O
size O
, O
shape O
and O
, O
especially O
, O
color O
. O

Sony B-ORG
uses O
mostly O
red O
and O
blue O
, O
with O
traces O
of O
yellow O
-- O
and O
so O
does O
Justin B-ORG
, O
on O
the O
theory O
that O
kids O
prefer O
these O
colors O
. O

-LRB- O
`` O
To O
be O
successful O
, O
a O

and O
Sony B-ORG
noticed O

Indeed O
, O
concerned O
that O
Sony B-ORG

were O
threatening O
legal O

other O
retaliation O

such O
as O
withholding O

against O
Justin B-ORG

, O
Mr. O
Baxley B-PER
fired O
off O
a O

to O
Sony B-ORG

He O
himself O

Justin B-ORG

pursued O
those O

were O
without O

, O
according O
to O
Mr. O

, O
the O
Sony B-ORG

Recalls O
Mr. O
Baxley B-PER
: O
`` O
Our O

As O
other O

particularly O
Poland B-LOC

the B-LOC
Soviet I-LOC
Union I-LOC
, O
have O
recently O
discovered O

initial O

As O
the B-MISC
days I-MISC
go O
by O
, O
the O
South B-MISC
African I-MISC
government O
will O
be O
ever O
more O
hard O
pressed O
to O
justify O
the O
continued O
imprisonment O
of O

as O

as O
the O

If O
it O

yield O

to O
the O
ANC B-ORG

the O

The O
newly O

be O
under O

if O

Pretoria B-LOC
will O
use O
this O
as O
a O
reason O
to O
keep O
Mr. O

Pretoria B-LOC
has O

for O
sabotage O

In O
addition O

the O

The O

cut O
was O
from O
the O
$ B-MISC
210 I-MISC
million I-MISC
Mr. O

pinched O
. O

Two B-MISC
former O
ministers O
were O
so O
heavily O
implicated O
in O
the O
Koskotas B-PER
affair O
that O
PASOK B-ORG
members O
of O
Parliament B-ORG
voted O
to O
refer O
them O
to O
the O
special O
court O
. O

But O
eluding O
parliamentary O
probe O
was O
the O
case O
of O
millions B-MISC
of I-MISC
drachmas I-MISC
Mr. O
Koskotas B-PER
funneled O
into O
New B-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
coffers O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
the O
investigation O
produced O
only O
circumstantial O
evidence O
and O
`` O
indications O
'' O
that O
point O
to O
PASOK B-ORG
, O
not O
clinching O
proof O
. O

On O
another O
issue O
, O
Greeks B-MISC
were O
told O
how O
their O
national O
intelligence O
agency O
, O
the O
EYP B-ORG
, O
regularly O
monitored O
the O

conversations O
of O
prominent O

, O

and O
PASOK B-ORG

. O

Despite O
convincing O
arguments O
, O
it O
was O
never O
established O
that O
Mr. O
Papandreou B-PER
personally O
ordered O
or O
directed O
the O
wiretaps O
. O

The O
central O
weakness O
of O
the O
`` O
scandals O
'' O
debates O
was O
pointed O
up O
especially O
well O
when O
discussions O
focused O
on O
arms O
deals O
and O
kickbacks O
. O

The O
coalition O

tried O
to O
show O
that O

Naturally O
, O
neither O
General B-ORG

could O
be O
expected O
to O
hamper O

-LRB- O
or O
not O

various O
Greek B-MISC

So O
it O
seems O
that O
Mr. O
Mitsotakis B-PER
and O
his O
communist O
chums O
may O
have O
unwittingly O
served O
Mr. O
Papandreou B-PER
a O
moral O
victory O
on O
a O
platter O
: O
PASOK B-ORG
, O
whether O
guilty O
or O
not O
, O
can O
now O
traipse O
the O
countryside O
condemning O
the O
whole O
affair O
as O
a O
witch O
hunt O
at O
Mr. O
Papandreou B-PER
's O
expense O
. O

But O
while O
verbal O
high O
jinks O
alone O
wo O
n't O
help O
PASOK B-ORG
regain O
power O
, O
Mr. O
Papandreou B-PER
should O
never O
be O
underestimated O
. O

First B-MISC
came O
his O
predictable O
fusillade O
: O
He O
charged O
the O
Coalition B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Left I-ORG
and O
Progress B-ORG
had O
sold O
out O
its O
leftist O
tenets O
by O
collaborating O
in O
a O
right O
- O
wing O
plot O
aimed O
at O
ousting O
PASOK B-ORG
and O
thwarting O
the O
course O
of O
socialism O
in O
Greece B-LOC
. O

Then O
, O
to O
buttress O
his O
credibility O
with O
the O
left O
, O
he O
enticed O
some O
smaller O
leftist O
parties O
to O
stand O
for O
election O
under O
the O
PASOK B-ORG
banner O
. O

Next O
, O
he O
continued O
to O
court O
the O
communists O
-- O
many O
of O
whom O
feel O
betrayed O
by O
the O
left O
- O
right O
coalition O
's O
birth O
-- O
by O
bringing O
into O
PASOK B-ORG
a O
well O
- O
respected O
Communist B-ORG
Party I-ORG
candidate O
. O

For O
balance O
, O
and O
in O
hopes O
of O
gaining O
some O
disaffected O
centrist O
votes O
, O
he O
managed O
to O
attract O
a O
former O
New B-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
Party I-ORG
representative O
and O
known O
political O
enemy O
of O
Mr. O
Mitsotakis B-PER
. O

Thus O
PASOK B-ORG
heads O
for O
the O
polls O
not O
only O
with O
diminished O
scandal O
- O
stench O
, O
but O
also O
with O
`` O
seals O
of O
approval O
'' O
from O
representatives O
of O
its O
harshest O
accusers O
. O

Crucial O
as O
these O
elections O
are O
for O
Greece B-LOC
, O
pressing O
issues O
of O

are O
getting O
lost O
in O
the O

The O
country O

future O
NATO B-ORG
participation O
remains O
unsure O
, O
for O
instance O
. O

Greece B-LOC
also O
must O
revamp O

pieces O
of O
legislation O
in O
preparation O
for O
the O
1992 B-MISC
targets O
of O
heightened O
Common O
Market O
cooperation O
. O

Greece B-LOC

bilateral O
relations O
with O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
need O
attention O
soon O
as O
well O
. O

For O
one B-MISC
, O
the O
current O
accord O
concerning O
U.S. B-LOC
military O
bases O
in O
Greece B-LOC
lapses O
in O
May B-MISC
1990 I-MISC
. O

Negotiations O
for O
a O
new O
agreement O
were O
frozen O
before O
the O
June B-MISC
elections O
, O
but O
the O
clock O
is O
running O
. O

Another O
matter O
of O
concern O
is O
the O
extradition O
of O
Mohammed B-PER
Rashid I-PER
, O
a O
Palestinian B-MISC
terrorist O
who O
is O
wanted O
in O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
for O
the O
1982 B-MISC
bombing O
of O
a O
Pan B-ORG
American I-ORG

. O

The O
Greek B-MISC
courts O
have O
decided O
in O
favor O
of O
extradition O
in O
the O
Rashid B-PER
case O
, O
but O
the O
matter O
awaits O
final O
approval O
from O
Greece B-LOC
's O
next O
justice O
minister O
. O

The O
Greeks B-MISC
seem O
barely O
aware O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
case O
as O
a O
litmus O
test O
of O
whether O
Greece B-LOC
will O
be O
counted O
in O
or O
out O
for O
international O
efforts O
to O
combat O
terrorism O
. O

That O
PASOK B-ORG
could O
win O
the O
elections O
outright O
is O
improbable O
; O
the O
Greek B-MISC
press O
, O
previously O
eager O
to O
palm O
off O
PASOK B-ORG
's O
line O
, O
has O
turned O
on O
Mr. O

with O
a O
wild O
- O

vengeance O
. O

Yet O
the O
possibility O
of O
another O
lash O
- O
up O
government O
is O
all O
too O
real O
. O

If O
Mr. O
Papandreou B-PER
becomes O
the O
major O
opposition O
leader O
, O
he O
could O
hamstring O
a O
conservative O
- O
led O

. O

Also O
, O
he O
could O
force O
new O
elections O
early B-MISC
next I-MISC

by O
frustrating O
the O
procedures O
for O
the O
election O
of O
the O

New B-ORG

once O
again O
glaringly O

linked O

though O
its O

What O
is O
one O
to O
think O
of O
all O
this O
? O

Doctrine O

special O

govern O
some O
responses O
. O

People O
eager O
to O
have O
youth O
`` O
pay O
their O
dues O
to O
society O
'' O
favor O
service O
proposals O
-- O
preferably O
mandatory O
ones O
. O

So O
do O
those O
who O
seek O
a O
`` O
re-energized O
concept O
of O
citizenship O
, O
'' O
a O
concept O
imposing O
stern O
obligations O
as O
well O
as O
conferring O
rights O
. O

Then O
there O
are O
instinctive O
opponents O
. O

To O
libertarians O
, O
mandatory O
service O
is O
an O
abomination O
and O
voluntary O
systems O
are O
illegitimate O
uses O
of O
tax O
money O
. O

Devotees O
of O
the O
market O
question O
the O
value O
of O
the O
work O
national O
service O
would O
perform O
: O

If O
the O
market O
wo O
n't O
pay O
for O
it O
, O
they O
argue O
, O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
worth O
its O
cost O
. O

Elements O
of O
the O
left O
are O
also O
reflexively O
opposed O
; O
they O
see O
service O
as O
a O
cover O
for O
the O
draft O
, O
or O
fear O
the O
regimentation O
of O
youth O
, O
or O
want O
to O
see O
rights O
enlarged O
, O
not O
obligations O
. O

But O
what O
about O
those O
of O
us O
whose O
views O
are O
not O
predetermined O
by O
formula O
or O
ideology O
? O

How O
should O
we O
think O
about O
national O
service O
? O

Let O
's O
begin O
by O
recognizing O
a O
main O
source O
of O
confusion O
-- O
`` O
national O
service O
'' O
has O
no O
agreed O
meaning O
. O

Would O
service O
be O
voluntary O
or O
compulsory O
? O

Short O
or O
long O
? O

Part O
- O
time O
or O
full O
- O
time O
? O

Paid O
or O
unpaid O
? O

Would O
participants O
live O
at O
home O
and O
work O
nearby O
or O
live O
in O
barracks O
and O
work O
on O
public O
lands O
? O

What O
kinds O
of O
work O
would O
they O
do O
? O

What O
does O
`` O
national O
'' O
mean O
? O

Would O
the O
program O
be O
run O
by O
the O
federal O
government O
, O
by O
local O
governments O
, O
or O
by O
private O
voluntary O
organizations O
? O

And O
who O
would O
serve O
? O

Only O
males O
, O
as O
with O
the O
draft O
, O
or O
both O
sexes O
? O

Youth O
only O
or O
all O
ages O
? O

Middle O
- O
class O
people O
, O
or O
poor O
people O
, O
or O
a O
genuine O
cross-section O
? O

Many O
or O
few O
? O

Those O
are O
not O
trivial O
questions O
, O
and O
the O
label O
`` O
national O
service O
'' O
answers O
none O
of O
them O
. O

Then O
how O
should O
we O
think O
about O
national O
service O
? O

As O
a O
starting O
point O
, O
here O
are O
five B-MISC
propositions O
: O
1 B-MISC
. O
Consider O
the O
ingredients O
, O
not O
the O
name O
. O

Ignore O
`` O
national O
service O
'' O
in O
the O
abstract O
; O
consider O
specific O
proposals O
. O

They O
will O
differ O
in O
crucial O
ways O
. O

2 B-MISC
. O
`` O
Service O
'' O
should O
be O
service O
. O

As O
commonly O
understood O
, O
service O
implies O
sacrifice O
. O

It O
involves O
accepting O
risk O
, O
or O
giving O
up O
income O
, O
or O
deferring O
a O
career O
. O

It O
follows O
that O
proposals O
like O
Nunn B-PER
- O
McCurdy O
, O
whose O
benefits O
to O
enrollees O
are O
worth O
some O
$ O
17,500 B-MISC
a B-MISC
year I-MISC
, O
do O
not O
qualify O
. O

There O
is O
a O
rationale O
for O
such O
bills O
: O
Federal O
subsidies O
to O
college O
students O
amount O
to O
`` O
a B-MISC
GI I-MISC
Bill I-MISC
without O
the O
GI O
'' O
; O
arguably O
those O
benefits O
should O
be O
earned O
, O
not O
given O
. O

But O
the O
earnings O
exceed O
by O
20 B-MISC
% I-MISC
the O
average O
income O
of O
young O
high O
- O
school O
graduates O
with O
full O
- O
time O
jobs O
. O

Why O
call O
that O
service O
? O

3 B-MISC
. O
Encouragement O
is O
fine O
; O
compulsion O
is O
not O
. O

Compelled O
service O
is O
unconstitutional O
. O

It O
is O
also O
unwise O
and O
unenforceable O
. O

-LRB- O
Who O
will O
throw O
several B-MISC
hundred I-MISC
thousand I-MISC
refusers O
in O
jail O
each O
year O
? O
-RRB- O

But O
through O
tax O
policy O
and O
in O
other O
ways O
the O
federal O
government O
encourages O
many O
kinds O
of O
behavior O
. O

It O
should O
also O
encourage O
service O
-- O
preferably O
by O
all O
classes O
and O
all O
ages O
. O

Its O
encouragement O
should O
strengthen O
and O
not O
undercut O
the O
strong O
tradition O
of O
volunteering O
in O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
, O
should O
build O
on O
the O
service O
programs O
already O

honor O
local O
convictions O
about O
which O
tasks O
most O
need O
doing O

Good O
programs O
are O
not O
cheap O
. O

Enthusiasts O
assume O
that O

would O
get O
important O
work O
done O
cheaply O
: O
forest O

fought O
, O

There O
is O
important O
work O
to O
be O
done O
, O
and O
existing O
service O
and O
conservation O
corps O
have O
shown O
that O
even O
youths O
who O
start O
with O
few O
skills O
can O
do O
much O
of O
it O
well O
-- O
but O
not O
cheaply O
. O

Good O
service O
programs O
require O
recruitment O
, O
screening O
, O
training O
and O
supervision O
-- O
all O
of O
high O
quality O
. O

They O
involve O
stipends O
to O
participants O
. O

Full O
- O
time O
residential O
programs O
also O
require O
housing O
and O
full O
- O
time O
supervision O
; O
they O
are O
particularly O
expensive O
-- O
more O
per O
participant O
than O
a B-MISC
year I-MISC
at O
Stanford B-ORG
or O
Yale B-ORG
. O

Non-residential O
programs O
are O
cheaper O
, O
but O
good O
ones O
still O
come O
to O
some O
$ O
10,000 B-MISC
a O
year O
. O

Are O
they O
worth O
that O
? O

Evaluations O
suggest O
that O
good O
ones O
are O
-- O
especially O
so O
if O
the O
effects O
on O

are O
counted O

But O
the O
calculations O
are O
challengeable O

Underclass O

a O
special O

, O
then O
? O

Yes O
, O
if O
targeted O
. O

People O
of O
all O
ages O
and O
all O

should O
be O
encouraged O

there O
are O
many O
ways O
for O
middle O

their O

surrounded O
by O

But O
many O

quite O

At O

it O
seemed O

As O

yesterday B-MISC

the B-ORG

, O
stocks O
of O
many O

By O
10:10 B-MISC

the B-ORG

By O
the O

more B-MISC

any O

, O
in O
sharp O

to O
Black B-MISC

But O
the O

was O
largely O

more O

a O

began O
the B-MISC

off O

The O

, O
after O

sharply O
in O

to O
139.10 B-MISC

bounced O

thus O
easing O

that O

And O
the O
widely O

among O
most O

that O
a O

came O
into O

yesterday B-MISC

buy O
some O
of O

Still O
, O
amid O
all O
the O
backslapping O
and O
signs O
of O
relief O
over O
yesterday B-MISC

, O
some O

prevent O

`` O

that O
a O

is O
often O
passed O
around O
the O

. O

So O
investors O
everywhere O
nervously O
eyed O
yesterday B-MISC

opening O
in O
Tokyo B-LOC

where O
the O
Nikkei O
average O
of O
225 B-MISC

a O

600 I-MISC

or O
1.7 B-MISC

in O
the O

20 B-MISC

the O

no O

the O

upward O
by O
200 B-MISC

then O
drifted O
lower O

they O

this O

Aides O
both O

the O
withdrawal O

said O

the O

clearly O

can O
take O
the O
drastic O
step O

revoking O
the O
operating O
certificate O
of O

official O
considers O

Supporters O
of O
the O

view O
the O

an O
effort O
to O
add O
stability O

to O

to O
provide O
all O
information O

The O
bill O
would O
allow O

out O
if O
sufficient O

`` O

The O

Even O
if O
that O

however O

it O

probably O
the O

the O

confirmed O

correct O
to O
find O
that O

, O
what O
are O
the O

all O
, O
the O
stock O
market O

response O
to O
the O

of O
the O
UAL B-ORG

might O
be O
taken O
to O
confirm O
the O

Is O
this O
a O
case O
where O
private O

are O
approving O
of O
Washington B-LOC

bashing O
of O
Wall O

? O

Absolutely O
not O
. O

To O
the O
extent O
that O
Friday B-MISC
's O
sell O
- O
off O
reflected O
a O
sudden O
reappraisal O
of O
the O
excesses O
of O
leverage O
, O
the O
message O
is O
that O
Wall O
Street O
and O
the O
private O
markets O
are O
fully O
capable O
of O
imposing O
the O
appropriate O
incentives O
and O
sanctions O
on O
corporate O
behavior O
. O

The O
national O
economic O
interests O
are O
much O
better O
served O
allowing O
the O
private O
interests O
of O
bankers O
and O
investors O
be O
the O
ultimate O
judges O
of O
the O
investment O
quality O
of O
various O
LBO O
deals O
and O

The O
recent O
difficulties O
in O
the O
junk O
- O
bond O
markets O
and O
the O
scarcity O
of O
bank O
capital O
for O
recent O
deals O
underscores O
the O
wisdom O
of O
letting O
the O
free O
markets O
operate O
. O

If O
takeover O
premiums O
become O
excessive O
, O
if O
LBO O
dealmakers O
become O
too O
aggressive O
, O
then O
the O
private O
market O
will O
recognize O
these O
problems O
more O
quickly O
and O
accurately O
than O
will O
policy O
makers O
, O
and O
the O
markets O
will O
move O
with O
lightning O
speed O
to O
impose O
appropriate O
sanctions O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
broader O
exchanges O
got O
caught O
up O
in O
the O
spiral O
, O
but O
they O
rode O
the O
tiger O
up O
all B-MISC
year I-MISC
. O

Not O
surprisingly O
, O
he O
sometimes O
bites O
. O

The O
arbitragers O
and O
takeover O
initiatiors O
got O
killed O
on O
Gray B-MISC
Friday I-MISC
, O
while O
the O
besieged O
managers O
of O
prospective O
targets O
cheered O
lustily O
. O

If O
you O
identify O
with O
the O
besieged O
managers O
, O
you O
must O
concede O
that O
speedy O
and O
effective O
relief O
from O
the O
excesses O
of O
the O
takeover O
market O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
come O
from O
the O
marketplace O
than O
from O
Washington B-LOC
. O

If O
you O
side O
with O
the O
arbitragers O
and O
raiders O
, O
you O
clearly O
have O
more O
to O
fear O
from O
private O
investors O
than O
from O
regulators O
, O
although O
the O
Delaware B-LOC
courts O
should O
never O
be O
underestimated O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
Washington B-LOC
understands O
politics O
better O
than O
economics O
. O

Although O
the O
average O
citizen O
is O
probably O
not O
harmed O
too O
much O
from O
Washington B-LOC
's O
rhetorical O
war O
against O
Wall O
Street O
regarding O
excessive O
financial O
leveraging O
, O
actual O
legislation O
would O
probably O
impose O
considerable O
harm O
. O

Any O
such O
attempt O
to O
distinguish O
`` O
good O
debt O
'' O
from O
`` O
bad O
debt O
, O
'' O
or O
to O
draw O
the O
line O
at O
a O
particular O
industry O
, O
such O
as O
the O

, O
is O
likely O
to O
blunt O
the O
spur O
that O
the O
proper O
amount O
of O

provides O
both O
to O

and O

better O
for O

the O

out O
of O

over O

What O
happened O
Friday B-MISC
shows O
that O
financial O
markets O
are O
not O
yet O
sufficiently O
coordinated O
to O
handle O
another O
meltdown O
in O
prices O
. O

No O
fiddling O
with O
systems O
and O
procedures O
will O
ever O
prevent O
markets O
from O
suffering O
a O
panic O
wave O
of O
selling O
. O

But O
markets O
can O
operate O
with O
greater O
or O
lesser O
efficiency O
. O

After O
the O
1987 B-MISC
plunge O
, O
markets O
agreed O
that O
it O
would O
be O
wise O
to O
halt O
trading O
whenever O
panic O
conditions O
arose O
. O

The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Stock I-ORG
Exchange I-ORG
adopted O
two B-MISC
specific O
circuit O
breakers O
: O
If O
the O
Dow B-ORG
Jones I-ORG
index O
falls O
250 B-MISC
points O
in O
a B-MISC
day I-MISC
, O
the O
exchange O
will O
halt O
trading O
for O
one B-MISC
hour I-MISC
; O
if O
the O
decline O
hits O
400 B-MISC
points O
, O
the O
exchange O
will O
close O
for O
an O
additional O
two B-MISC
hours I-MISC
. O

The O
rationale O
is O
that O
an O
interruption O
of O
trading O
will O
allow O
investors O
to O
reconsider O
their O
strategies O
, O
calm O
sellers O
and O
lead O
buyers O
to O
enter O
the O
market O
at O
indicated O
new O
price O
levels O
. O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
know O
whether O
that O
theory O
is O
realistic O
. O

A O
temporary O
cessation O
of O
trading O
may O
indeed O
discourage O
a O
selling O
panic O
from O
feeding O
on O
itself O
. O

But O
there O
is O
also O
the O
possibility O
that O
shutting O
down O
markets O
will O
intensify O
fears O
and O
cause O
an O
even O
more O
abrupt O
slide O
in O
prices O
. O

What O
happened O
Friday B-MISC
was O
the O
worst O
of O
all O
worlds O
. O

The O
futures O

followed O
their O
own O
pre-set O
circuit O

and O
shut O
down O
at O
about B-MISC
3 I-MISC
p.m. I-MISC

30 B-MISC

after O

fallen O
12 B-MISC

As O

, O
most O
probably O
, O
would O
have O
been O
less O
intense O
. O

At O
3:30 B-MISC
, O
after O
intense O
telephone O
negotiations O
between O
the O
trading O
markets O
and O
Washington B-LOC
, O
the O

reopened O
. O

Futures O
trading O
, O
however O
, O
was O
halted O
altogether O
at O
3:45 B-MISC
, O
after O
the O

had O
dropped O
an B-MISC
additional I-MISC
30 I-MISC
points O
, O
which O
is O
the O
daily B-MISC
limit O
for O
price O
declines O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
options O
markets O
also O
shut O
down O
and O
once O
more O
left O
all O
sales O
to O
be O
handled O
by O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG

It O
is O
time O
to O

, O
the O

though O
physically O

have O

become O

closely O

can O
vary O
their O
strategies O
and O
execute O
their O

It O
therefore O
makes O
no O
sense O
for O

to O
adopt O
different O
circuit O

To O
achieve O
maximum O

, O
either O
all O

should O
be O
open O

none O

Synchronized O
circuit O

would O
not O
have O

Friday B-MISC
, O
but O
they O
probably O
would O
have O
made O

smoother O
, O
less O
volatile O
executions O
. O

It O
's O
time O
for O
the O

the B-ORG

The O

if O

are O
to O

the B-ORG

Not O

Californians B-MISC

all O

would O
pay O
if O
this O

The O

bars O
the O
sale O

California B-LOC
that O

meet O
the O

In O

words O
, O
California B-LOC
is O
presuming O
to O
take O
control O
of O
the O
nation O
's O
farm O
policy O
. O

As O
usual O
the O
green O
lobby O
's O
proposal O
is O
disconnected O
from O
scientific O
reality O
. O

Consider O
the O
greenhouse O
- O
effect O
provision O
. O

The O
proposed O
initiative O
would O
mandate O
a O
reduction O
of O
carbon O

of O
40 B-MISC
% I-MISC
. O

Even O
if O
one O
buys O
into O
the O

theory O
, O
it O
is O
inconceivable O
that O
reductions O
in O
a O

state O
could O
have O
any O
impact O
on O
what O
is O
billed O
as O
a O
global O
problem O

But O
if O
rational O
science O
and O
economics O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
new O
environment O
initiative O
, O
what O
is O
going O
on O
? O

The O
first B-MISC
place O
to O
look O
under O
these O
circumstances O
is O
at O
the O
ways O
in O
which O
the O
sponsors O
themselves O
will O
benefit O
. O

The O
key O
here O
is O
the O
ambition O
of O
state O
Attorney O
General O
John B-PER
Van I-PER

Kamp I-PER
. O

He O
's O
running O
for O
governor O

Mr. O
Van B-PER
de I-PER
Kamp I-PER
is O
the O
one O
who O
collected O
the O
plans O
from O
the O
various O
radical O
environmental O
groups O
and O
cobbled O
them O
into O
a O
single O
unwieldy O
initiative O
to O
be O
placed O
on O
the O
ballot O
for O
election O
on O
Nov. B-MISC
6 I-MISC
, I-MISC
1990 I-MISC
. O

That O
's O
also O
the B-MISC
day I-MISC
of O
the O
gubernatorial O
election O
. O

The O
initiative O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
crafted O
to O
include O
all O
the O
hot O
issues O
that O
set O
off O
the O
wealthy O
Hollywood B-LOC
weepers O
who O
donate O
money O
. O

And O
it O
allows O
Mr. O
Van B-PER

Kamp I-PER
to O
get O
around O
campaign O
spending O
limits O
. O

He O
can O
spend O
the O
legal O
maximum O

; O
all O
the O

for O
the O
Van B-PER
de I-PER
Kamp I-PER
initiative O
-LRB- O
on O
which O
there O
are O
no O
limits O
-RRB- O
is O
gravy O
. O

This O
initiative O
is O
being O
labeled O
The O
Big O
Green O
, O
but O
maybe O
it O
should O
be O
called O
The O
Big O
Greenback O
. O

-LRB- O
The O
Republican B-MISC

Sen. O
Pete B-PER

is O
playing O
the O

game O
too O
, O
sponsoring O
his O
own O
crime O
initiative O
. O
-RRB- O

While O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
Big O
Green O
initiative O
will O
be O
ruled O
unconstitutional O
, O
it O
is O
of O
course O
conceivable O
that O
in O
modern O
California B-LOC
it O
could O
slide O
through O
. O

This O
is O
the O
state O
that O
recently O
passed O
the O
Prop. O
65 O
anti-toxic O
initiative O
. O

If O
this O
new O
proposal O
ever O
does O
become O
law O
, O
the O
green O
lobby O
will O
benefit O
directly O
. O

The O
initiative O
creates O
a O
free O
floating O
state O
environmental O
officer O
to O
sue O
companies O
or O
government O
agencies O
that O
do O
things O
he O
does O
n't O
like O
. O

That O
means O
the O
NRDC B-ORG
and O
such O
groups O
no O
longer O
would O
have O
to O
spend O
as O
much O
money O
on O
litigation O
; O
taxpayers O
would O
bear O
the O
cost O
. O

Mr. O
Van B-PER
de I-PER
Kamp I-PER
and O
his O
allies O
may O
be O
hoping O
that O
the O

is O
such O
a O

among O
certain O
segments O

that O
almost O
any O
collection O
of O
anti-scientific O

anti-pocketbook O
nonsense O
can O
pass O
under O
its O
rubric O
. O

Of O

the O
state O

liberals O
are O
not O
yet O
a O
nation O
unto O
themselves O
. O

George B-PER

may O
decide O
that O

lost O

from O
California B-LOC

And O
some O
other O
segments O
of O
California B-LOC

political O
and O
media O
culture O
may O
yet O
start O
to O
point O
out O
that O
the O

state O

the O
form O

This O
grandiose O
initiative O
will O
help O
California B-LOC
define O
itself O
for O
the O
future O
either O
as O
a O
state O
still O

Jiaju B-PER
Hou I-PER
believed O
that O
the O
" O

policy O
would O
also O
have O
influence O

Because O
, O
among O
exports O
from O
Taiwan B-LOC
to O
our O
country O
's O
mainland O
, O
a O
large O
portion O
are O
due O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
businessmen O
investing O
in O
setting O
up O

our O

needing O

In O
recent B-MISC
years I-MISC
, O
Taiwan B-LOC

trade O
surplus O

our O

has O
accumulatively O

80 B-MISC

which O
is O
almost O

While O

the O

this O

How O
can O

decrease O

for O
the O
sake O
of O
" O
do O

" O
? O

Because O
this O
will O
reduce O
its O

Jiaju B-PER
Hou I-PER
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
" O
do O

, O
be O
patient O
" O
policy O
would O
also O
restrain O
foreign O

Because O

. O

Therefore O
, O
this O
policy O
, O
while O

the O

also O
limit O

The O
IC O
market O
in O
the O
telecommunications O
sector O
still O
has O
great O
potential O




Currently O
, O
in O
areas O
like O
Tianjin O
, O
Hebei O
, O
Shanxi O
, O
Gansu O
, O
and O
Xinjiang O
, O
employers O
no O
longer O
directly O
pay O
the O
heating O
bills O
; O
instead O
, O
work O
units O
would O
distribute O
special O
subsidies O
to O
their O
employees O
, O
who O
would O
then O
pay O
their O
own O
heating O
expenses O
; O
hence O
, O
the O
reform O
of O
heating O
bill O
payment O
has O
changed O
from O
an O
" O
implicit O
subsidy O
" O
to O
an O
" O
explicit O
subsidy O
" O
system O
. O

For O
years O
, O
those O
who O
have O
enjoyed O
the O
" O
implicit O
subsidy O
" O
benefits O
are O
those O
who O
are O
within O
the O
system O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
employees O
of O
party O
and O
government O
organizations O
, O
institutions O
, O
and O
state O
- O
owned O
enterprises O
with O
good O
returns O
. O

But O
for O
the O
large O
number O
of O
people O
who O
work O
outside O
the O
system O
, O
who O
has O
ever O
enjoyed O
the O
" O
implicit O
subsidy O
" O
benefits O
for O
their O
heating O
bills O
? O

In O
fact O
, O
independently O
operated O
state O
- O
owned O
enterprises O
and O
institutions O
that O
are O
financially O
responsible O
for O
their O
own O
profits O
and O
losses O
have O
already O
had O
an O
" O
explicit O
" O
subsidy O
system O
as O
long O
as O
they O
are O
financially O
strong O
. O

The O
reform O
from O
" O
implicit O
subsidy O
" O
to O
" O
explicit O
subsidy O
" O
only O
affects O
party O
and O
government O
organizations O
with O
financial O
allocation O
. O

Such O
a O
subsidy O
does O
not O
expand O
the O
coverage O
, O
it O
only O
offers O
subsidies O
to O
the O
original O
groups O
of O
people O
who O
were O
entitled O
to O
such O
benefits O
. O

If O
employees O
of O
party O
and O
government O
organizations O
as O
well O
as O
state O
- O
owned O
enterprises O
and O
institutions O
pay O
the O
same O
rate O
for O
water O
and O
electricity O
as O
those O
who O
work O
in O
the O
private O
sector O
or O
who O
are O
self O
- O
employed O
, O
why O
ca O
n't O
they O
pay O
the O
same O
rate O
for O
heat O




Not O

and O
the O

a O

are O
all O
important O
for O

The O

is O
20.4 O

but O
those O
entering O
the O

are O
getting O
increasingly O
younger O
. O

In O
general O
, O
the O
players O
have O
to O
retire O
after O
25 O
years O

. O

But O
presently O
the O
future O
outlook O
for O
retired O
players O
is O
also O
quite O
good O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
can O
enter O
the O
air O
force O
gaming O
team O
as O
special O
talents O

Furthemore O
, O
some O
famous O
players O
can O
also O
remain O
in O
their O
teams O
as O
instructors O
or O
become O
TV O
commentators O
for O

. O

Still O
some O

can O
receive O

professional O

in O

later O
be O
