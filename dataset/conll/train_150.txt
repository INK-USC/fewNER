told O
a O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O

if O

that O

needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European B-ORG

. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

by O
EU B-ORG
Farm O

Franz B-PER
Fischler I-PER
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O

from O
the O

animal O
food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler B-PER
proposed O
EU-wide B-MISC
measures O
after O
reports O
from O

that O
under O

But O
Fischler B-PER
agreed O
to O
review O
his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU B-ORG

standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O

, O
questioned O
if O
such O

to O

. O
