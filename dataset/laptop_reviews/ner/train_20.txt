these	O

are	O
encased	O
in	O
a	O
soft	O

The	O

I	O

more	O

on	O
the	O

at	O

I	O
was	O

without	O

how	O

it	O
was	O

I	O
can	O
barely	O
use	O
any	O

because	O
they	O
will	O
not	O
stay	O

The	O
one	O
down	O
side	O

it	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
play	O
a	O

it	O
tends	O

2	O

going	O
into	O

and	O
both	O
fell	O
in	O

with	O
the	O

I	O
complain	O
again	O
...	O

This	O

is	O
insane	O

If	O
a	O
website	O
ever	O
freezes	O
(	O
which	O
is	O
rare	O
)	O
,	O
its	O
really	O
easy	O
to	O
force	B-aspectTerm
quit	I-aspectTerm
.	O

It	O
does	O
run	O
a	O
little	O
warm	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
negligible	O
concern	O

It	O
rarely	O
works	B-aspectTerm
and	O
when	O
it	O
does	O
it	O
's	O
incredibly	O
slow	O

I	O
also	O
enjoy	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
my	O
MacBook	O

laptop	O
allows	O
me	O
to	O
run	O
Windows	B-aspectTerm
7	I-aspectTerm
on	O
it	O
by	O
using	O
the	O
VMWare	B-aspectTerm
program	I-aspectTerm

It	O
's	O
so	O
much	O
easier	O
to	O
navigate	B-aspectTerm
through	O
the	O
operating	B-aspectTerm
system	I-aspectTerm
,	O
to	O
find	B-aspectTerm
files	I-aspectTerm

and	O
it	O
runs	B-aspectTerm
a	O

faster	O

Purchased	O

worked	O
good	O
until	O
just	O
after	O
the	O
warrenty	B-aspectTerm
went	O
out	O

I	O
always	O

would	O
never	O

an	O

This	O

I	O
really	O
honestly	O
love	O
it	O

for	O
2	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
purchase	O
the	O
extended	B-aspectTerm
warranty	I-aspectTerm
and	O
they	O
refused	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
trouble	O

Do	O
you	O
ever	O
think	O
HP	O
would	O
do	O
that	O
?	O
NEVER	O

We	O
upgraded	O
the	O

It	O
's	O
not	O

I	O
have	O
used	O
for	O
half	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
then	O
complained	O
about	O
it	O

Still	O
trying	O
to	O
learn	O
how	O
to	O
use	O
it	O

The	O
reality	O
was	O

it	O
heated	O
up	O
very	O
quickly	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
way	O
too	O
long	O
to	O
do	O
simple	O
things	O
,	O
like	O
opening	B-aspectTerm
my	I-aspectTerm
Documents	I-aspectTerm
folder	I-aspectTerm

I	O
bought	O
the	O

because	O
it	O
was	O
smaller	O

lighter	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
carry	O
around	O

The	O
Genius	O
at	O
the	O

advised	O
me	O
that	O

was	O
nothing	O
about	O
my	O

that	O
caused	O

this	O

I	O
had	O
always	O
used	O

been	O
constantly	O
frustrated	O
by	O
the	O
crashing	O

the	O
poorly	O

Sorry	O

within	O

the	O

I	O

a	O

Ok	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
probably	O
the	O
best	O
laptop	O

ever	O
devised	O
by	O
Apple	O

As	O
of	O
a	O
couple	O
weeks	O

the	O
middle	O

from	O

would	O

better	O

but	O
am	O
very	O
happy	O
with	O
the	O

Then	O

sends	O
it	O

me	O
with	O
the	O
hardware	B-aspectTerm
screwed	O
up	O
,	O
not	O
able	O

I	O
just	O
hope	O
the	O
reputation	O
that	O
Toshiba	O
has	O
is	O
true	O
and	O
I	O
wo	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O

about	O
a	O

Oh	O

That	O
is	O
my	O
only	O
complaint	O
!	O

The	O
salesman	O
talked	O
us	O
into	O
this	O
computer	O
away	O
from	O
another	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
at	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
had	O
nothing	O
but	O
problems	O
with	O
software	B-aspectTerm
problems	O
and	O
just	O
not	O
happy	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

That	O
system	B-aspectTerm
is	O
fixed	O
.	O

The	O
computer	O
itself	O
was	O
fast	O
,	O
ran	B-aspectTerm
smoothly	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
problems	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
smartest	O
thing	O
I	O
did	O
was	O
take	O
my	O
time	O
to	O
compare	O
laptops	O
before	O
making	O
my	O
purchase	O
.	O

Like	O
the	O
price	B-aspectTerm
and	O
operation	B-aspectTerm
.	O

The	O
brand	B-aspectTerm
is	O
tarnished	O
in	O
my	O
heart	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
likely	O
due	O
to	O
poor	O
grounding	O
and	O
isolation	O
between	O
the	O
components	B-aspectTerm
,	O
and	O
I	O
'm	O
hoping	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
fixed	O
with	O
a	O
ground	B-aspectTerm
loop	I-aspectTerm
isolator	I-aspectTerm
,	O
but	O
I	O
still	O
expected	O
better	O
product	O
quality	B-aspectTerm
for	O
this	O
price	B-aspectTerm
range	I-aspectTerm
.	O

Honestly	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
absolutely	O
wonderful	O

I	O
'	O
have	O
had	O
it	O
for	O
about	O

yes	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
an	O

I	O
really	O
wish	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
years	O

Well	O
,	O
maybe	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
very	O
unlucky	O

For	O

when	O
my	O
