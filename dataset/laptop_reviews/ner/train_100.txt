these	O

are	O
encased	O
in	O
a	O
soft	O

The	O

I	O

more	O

on	O
the	O

at	O

I	O
was	O

without	O

how	O

it	O
was	O

I	O
can	O
barely	O
use	O
any	O

because	O
they	O
will	O
not	O
stay	O

The	O
one	O
down	O
side	O

it	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
play	O
a	O

it	O
tends	O

2	O

going	O
into	O

and	O
both	O
fell	O
in	O

with	O
the	O

I	O
complain	O
again	O
...	O

This	O

is	O
insane	O

If	O
a	O
website	O
ever	O
freezes	O
(	O
which	O
is	O
rare	O
)	O
,	O
its	O
really	O
easy	O
to	O
force	B-aspectTerm
quit	I-aspectTerm
.	O

It	O
does	O
run	O
a	O
little	O
warm	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
negligible	O
concern	O

It	O
rarely	O
works	B-aspectTerm
and	O
when	O
it	O
does	O
it	O
's	O
incredibly	O
slow	O

I	O
also	O
enjoy	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
my	O
MacBook	O

laptop	O
allows	O
me	O
to	O
run	O
Windows	B-aspectTerm
7	I-aspectTerm
on	O
it	O
by	O
using	O
the	O
VMWare	B-aspectTerm
program	I-aspectTerm

It	O
's	O
so	O
much	O
easier	O
to	O
navigate	B-aspectTerm
through	O
the	O
operating	B-aspectTerm
system	I-aspectTerm
,	O
to	O
find	B-aspectTerm
files	I-aspectTerm

and	O
it	O
runs	B-aspectTerm
a	O

faster	O

Purchased	O

worked	O
good	O
until	O
just	O
after	O
the	O
warrenty	B-aspectTerm
went	O
out	O

I	O
always	O

would	O
never	O

an	O

This	O

I	O
really	O
honestly	O
love	O
it	O

for	O
2	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
purchase	O
the	O
extended	B-aspectTerm
warranty	I-aspectTerm
and	O
they	O
refused	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
trouble	O

Do	O
you	O
ever	O
think	O
HP	O
would	O
do	O
that	O
?	O
NEVER	O

We	O
upgraded	O
the	O

It	O
's	O
not	O

I	O
have	O
used	O
for	O
half	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
then	O
complained	O
about	O
it	O

Still	O
trying	O
to	O
learn	O
how	O
to	O
use	O
it	O

The	O
reality	O
was	O

it	O
heated	O
up	O
very	O
quickly	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
way	O
too	O
long	O
to	O
do	O
simple	O
things	O
,	O
like	O
opening	B-aspectTerm
my	I-aspectTerm
Documents	I-aspectTerm
folder	I-aspectTerm

I	O
bought	O
the	O

because	O
it	O
was	O
smaller	O

lighter	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
carry	O
around	O

The	O
Genius	O
at	O
the	O

advised	O
me	O
that	O

was	O
nothing	O
about	O
my	O

that	O
caused	O

this	O

I	O
had	O
always	O
used	O

been	O
constantly	O
frustrated	O
by	O
the	O
crashing	O

the	O
poorly	O

Sorry	O

within	O

the	O

I	O

a	O

Ok	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
probably	O
the	O
best	O
laptop	O

ever	O
devised	O
by	O
Apple	O

As	O
of	O
a	O
couple	O
weeks	O

the	O
middle	O

from	O

would	O

better	O

but	O
am	O
very	O
happy	O
with	O
the	O

Then	O

sends	O
it	O

me	O
with	O
the	O
hardware	B-aspectTerm
screwed	O
up	O
,	O
not	O
able	O

I	O
just	O
hope	O
the	O
reputation	O
that	O
Toshiba	O
has	O
is	O
true	O
and	O
I	O
wo	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O

about	O
a	O

Oh	O

That	O
is	O
my	O
only	O
complaint	O
!	O

The	O
salesman	O
talked	O
us	O
into	O
this	O
computer	O
away	O
from	O
another	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
at	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
had	O
nothing	O
but	O
problems	O
with	O
software	B-aspectTerm
problems	O
and	O
just	O
not	O
happy	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

That	O
system	B-aspectTerm
is	O
fixed	O
.	O

The	O
computer	O
itself	O
was	O
fast	O
,	O
ran	B-aspectTerm
smoothly	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
problems	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
smartest	O
thing	O
I	O
did	O
was	O
take	O
my	O
time	O
to	O
compare	O
laptops	O
before	O
making	O
my	O
purchase	O
.	O

Like	O
the	O
price	B-aspectTerm
and	O
operation	B-aspectTerm
.	O

The	O
brand	B-aspectTerm
is	O
tarnished	O
in	O
my	O
heart	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
likely	O
due	O
to	O
poor	O
grounding	O
and	O
isolation	O
between	O
the	O
components	B-aspectTerm
,	O
and	O
I	O
'm	O
hoping	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
fixed	O
with	O
a	O
ground	B-aspectTerm
loop	I-aspectTerm
isolator	I-aspectTerm
,	O
but	O
I	O
still	O
expected	O
better	O
product	O
quality	B-aspectTerm
for	O
this	O
price	B-aspectTerm
range	I-aspectTerm
.	O

Honestly	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
absolutely	O
wonderful	O

I	O
'	O
have	O
had	O
it	O
for	O
about	O

yes	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
an	O

I	O
really	O
wish	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
years	O

Well	O
,	O
maybe	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
very	O
unlucky	O

For	O

when	O
my	O

a	O

it	O

I	O

you	O

As	O
a	O

I	O
was	O
extremely	O

So	O
,	O
owing	O
to	O
these	O

,	O
I	O
went	O
out	O

got	O
myself	O
an	O

So	O
this	O
was	O

I	O

my	O

I	O
was	O
n't	O
a	O

fan	O
of	O
the	O

this	O
one	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
designed	B-aspectTerm

It	O
may	O
take	O
a	O
little	O
getting	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O

And	O
the	O

I	O
should	O

Moral	O
of	O
the	O
story:-Do	O
not	O

anything	O
from	O

that	O
do	O
not	O
respect	O

the	O
only	O
down	O

is	O
that	O

no	O

the	O
hinge	B-aspectTerm

you	O
to	O
place	O
various	O
connections	O
all	O
around	O
the	O
computer	O
,	O
left	O
right	O
and	O

I	O
have	O
owned	O
macbook	O
pros	O
since	O
2005	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
yet	O
!	O

I	O
was	O
loving	O
this	O
Netbook	O
because	O
it	O
had	O
an	O
amazing	O
screen	B-aspectTerm
and	O
display	B-aspectTerm
and	O
was	O
small	O
and	O
light	O
,	O
but	O
after	O
1	O
week	O
it	O
stopped	O
openning	O
web	O
pages	O
for	O
me	O
(	O
even	O
after	O
installing	O
new	O
browsers	B-aspectTerm
)	O
then	O
eventually	O
it	O
just	O
started	O
giving	O
me	O
a	O
blue	O
screen	O
and	O
crashing	O
everytime	O
I	O
booted	O
it	O

Now	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
myself	O
a	O
cheap	O
computer	O
,	O
that	O
will	O
probably	O
work	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O
better	O
!	O

I	O
would	O
definitely	O
not	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
using	O
a	O
PC	O
after	O
using	O
the	O
mac	O

I	O
'm	O
pretty	O
sure	O
it	O

but	O
when	O
you	O
turn	O
on	O
a	O
computer	O
you	O
just	O
bought	O
you	O
want	O
it	O
to	O
at	O

giving	O
me	O
a	O

I	O
dislike	O
the	O

the	O

The	O
screen	B-aspectTerm
graphics	I-aspectTerm

If	O

support	I-aspectTerm
(	O
which	O
is	O
good	O
too	O
)	O
and	O
they	O
went	O
through	O
it	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
just	O
a	O
safety	B-aspectTerm
feature	I-aspectTerm
and	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
affect	O
performance	B-aspectTerm
at	O
all	O

I	O
just	O
chose	O
to	O

out	O
there	O
to	O
get	O
this	O

So	O
I	O
got	O
another	O

I	O

But	O
in	O

it	O

the	O

But	O
I	O
do	O

a	O

Numerous	O
problems	O
over	O
the	O
next	O
3	O

had	O
to	O
send	O

this	O
will	O
happen	O

I	O
need	O

The	O

a	O

,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O

definitly	O

it	O

again	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
to	O

Took	O
a	O

clean	O
it	O
up	O

are	O

I	O

just	O

that	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
this	O
to	O
someone	O
in	O
need	O
of	O
a	O
cheap	O

with	O

decent	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
first	O

3	O
different	O

in	O
the	O

10	O
years	O
,	O
I	O
find	O
not	O
much	O
difference	O
except	O
of	O
course	O
for	O
the	O
screen	B-aspectTerm
size	I-aspectTerm
.	O

But	O
the	O
biggest	O
pain	O
is	O
that	O
tech	B-aspectTerm
support	I-aspectTerm
is	O
not	O
available	O
24/7	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
differences	O
that	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
know	O
and	O
take	O
time	O
to	O
learn	O

They	O
have	O
more	O
problems	O
then	O
a	O

Needless	O

My	O
first	O

The	O
most	O

that	O
my	O

I	O
have	O
just	O
been	O
using	O
firefox	B-aspectTerm

I	O
would	O
say	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
buy	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
machines	O
be	O
careful	O

Everything	O
about	O

very	O

The	O

THE	O

IS	O
THAT	O

there	O
went	O
another	O

The	O

feels	O

besides	O
the	O
added	O

Remember	O
to	O
do	O
your	O
research	O
first	O
before	O

buying	O
a	O
toshiba	O
product	O

I	O
bought	O
this	O

The	O

time	O
I	O
have	O

during	O

mac	O
is	O
extremely	O
different	O
than	O
any	O

The	O
feel	B-aspectTerm
of	O
this	O

the	O

we	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
happy	O
with	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
realized	O
that	O
trouble	O
was	O
brewing	O
.	O

They	O
break	O
down	O
just	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
PCs	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
viruses	O
,	O
is	O
because	O
no	O
one	O
makes	O
viruses	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
better	O
in	O

they	O
will	O
let	O
you	O

it	O

you	O
are	O

they	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
it	O
